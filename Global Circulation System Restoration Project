# Part II: Ideological foundations

## -Re-Recognition of Natural Laws and Continuous Laws-

-----

# Chapter 1: The Four Principles of Human Survival

-----

## 1.1 Outline of the Four Principles

In order for humanity to build a sustainable civilization, it is necessary to understand and practice the basic principles based on the laws of nature and sustainability.

This chapter defines the four principles of human survival and clarifies their significance.

-----

### Definition of the Four Principles

```
1. 摂理（Law of Nature / Providence）
2. 調和（Harmony）
3. 循環（Circulation / Cycle）
4. 構造（Structure）
```

These four principles are not independent, but are interrelated and mutually supportive and integrated systems.

-----

## 1.2 First Principle: Law of Nature / Providence

### Definitions

Providence is the fundamental structure and law of the universe and nature. **

It is a universal principle that exists independently of human will and desire and governs all phenomena.

### Basic Concepts

#### The Immutability of Providence

Providence has the following characteristics:

- **Universality**: Applied beyond time and space
- **Immutability**: Artificially unchangeable
- **Necessity**: Acts
without exception - **Objectivity**: Does not depend on the observer

#### Providence Examples

Physical Providence:

- Law
of gravity - Law of thermodynamics (increasing entropy)
- Law of conservation of energy

Biological Providence:

- Birth, growth, and death
of life - Evolution
of species - Equilibrium of ecosystems

Earth Science Providence:

- Water cycle
- Atmospheric circulation
- Crustal fluctuations

### Human Civilization and Providence

#### Adaptation to Providence vs. Rebellion against Providence

**Examples of adaptations:**

- Agriculture: Following
the Cycles of Seasons - Architecture: Responding to
Gravity and Climate - Medicine: Supporting the Body's Natural Healing Power

**Examples of Rebellion:**

- Mass consumption of fossil fuels: disruption
of the carbon cycle - Mass production and disposal: Ignoring
the material cycle - Destruction of ecosystems: Neglect of biodiversity

#### Consequences of ignoring providence

Lessons from history:

1. **The Collapse of Civilization**

- Mesopotamia: Degradation
of farmland due to salt damage - Easter Island: Ecosystem collapse
due to deforestation - Mayan civilization: Depletion of water resources

1. **Modern Crisis**

- Climate change: disrupting
the carbon cycle - Marine pollution: ignoring
the material cycle - Biodiversity loss: destroying ecosystems

### Reaffirming Providence

**For humanity to survive:**

1. **Humility**: Let go of the arrogance of being able to control
nature1. **Observation**: Gaining a deep understanding of
nature's laws1. **Adaptation**: Building
technological and social systems in line with providence1. **Respect**: Respect and coexist with nature

-----

## 1.3 Second Principle: Harmony

### Definitions

Harmony is the maintenance of balance between nature, society, and individuals. **

It means coexistence rather than confrontation, cooperation rather than domination, and distribution rather than monopoly.

### The Three-Layer Structure of Harmony

#### 1. Harmony with nature

**Symbiosis between humans and the natural environment**

- Sustainable use
of resources - Conservation of ecosystems
- Stabilization
of the climate - Maintenance of biodiversity

**Examples of Lost Harmony:**

- Heat Island Phenomenon: Disharmony between Cities and Nature
- Marine Dead Zones: Disharmony between anthropogenic activities and the
oceans - Increasing forest fires: Climate change and forest disharmony

#### 2. Harmony with society

**Coexistence between humans**

- Respect
for cultural diversity - Reducing
economic disparities - Promoting
international cooperation - Intergenerational equity

**The Current State of Disharmony:**

- Widening
gap between rich and poor - Conflict
over resources - Clash
of cultures and religions - Debt to the next generation (environmental destruction and budget deficit)

#### 3. Harmony with the individual

**Harmony with the Self**

- Physical and mental health
- Mental stability
- Realization
of purpose in life - Inner peace

**Symptoms of disharmony:**

- Stressful society
- Increase in
mental illness - Death from overwork and suicide
- Loss of meaning of life

### How to Achieve Harmony

#### Principles

1. **Dialogue**: Deepening
Mutual Understanding 1. **Compromise**: Aiming for Overall
Optimization1. **Empathy**: Understanding
Others' Perspectives1. **Tolerance**: Embracing Differences

#### Practice

- **Respect for diversity**: Acknowledging different values
- **Coexistence and co-prosperity**: Building a win-win relationship
- **Symbiosis**: Taking the interests of others as
one's own - **Equity**: Equitable distribution of resources and opportunities

-----

## 1.4 第三原則:循環(Circulation / Cycle)

### Definitions

Circulation is the continuous flow of resources, energy, and life. **

It means a circle rather than a one-way street, metabolism rather than consumption, and regeneration rather than disposal.

### Cycles in Nature

#### 1. Water Circulation

```
蒸発 → 雲 → 降雨 → 河川 → 海 → 蒸発
```

- Powered
by solar energy - Circulated
throughout the planet - Source of fresh water

**Man-made Destruction:**

- Dam blocking
of flow - Over-extraction
of groundwater - Water pollution

#### 2. Carbon cycle

```
Atmospheric CO2 → Photosynthesis → Organic matter → Respiration/decomposition → CO2
```

- Natural cycle
of about 10 billion tons/year - Oceans and forests are the source of absorption

**Man-made Destruction:**

- Fossil fuel burning: about 40 billion tons of CO2 emissions
per year - Deforestation: loss
of sinks - Ocean acidification: Reduced absorption capacity

#### 3. Nutrient circulation

```
表層 → 生物生産 → 死滅沈降 → 深層 → 湧昇 → 表層
```

- Supporting ocean productivity
- Vertical circulation is key

**Man-made Destruction:**

- Stratification
due to global warming - Cessation
of vertical circulation - Expansion of dead zones

### Cycles in Human Society

#### Circular Systems in Traditional Societies

**Japan in the Edo Period:**

- Excrement → Fertilizer → Crops → Food → Excrement
- Clothing: Kimono → Rags → Rags → Fuel
- Construction: Wood → Construction → Demolition → Reuse

**Result:**

- Almost 100% resource recycling
- Maintaining a sustainable society for 300 years

#### Modern Linear Systems

```
Resource Extraction → Production → Consumption → Disposal
```

**Problem:**

- Depletion
of resources - Accumulation
of waste - Environmental pollution
- Unsustainable

### Restructuring Circulation

#### Recycling-oriented society to aim for

**Principle:**

1. Reduce: Reduce
waste1. **Reuse**: Reuse
1. **Recycle**: Returning to Resources
1. **Regenerate**: Regenerate with the power of nature

**Specific examples:**

- Organic Waste → Compost → Agriculture
- Waste Plastics → Recycled Plastics
- Sewage → Purification → Reused Water
- CO2 → Algae Culture → Biofuels

-----

## 1.5 Fourth Principle: Structure

### Definitions

Structure is the design of stable social, technological and natural infrastructure. **

It means design rather than chance, reason rather than emotion, and long-term rather than short-term.

### Importance of Structure

#### Why Structure

Hope is not an emotion, but a structure. **

- Emotional: temporary, unstable
- Structure: persistent, stable

**Example:**

- "If you work hard, you will be able to do something" (emotion)
- vs
- "This system will last" (structure)

### Principles of Structural Design

#### 1. Long-term perspective

**Short-Term Optimal vs. Long-Term Optimum**

Examples of short-term optimization:

- Fossil fuels: Useful now, but debt
in the future - Mass production: Cheap now, but waste accumulation

Examples of long-term optimization:

- Renewable energy: large initial investment but sustainable
- Circular systems: complex design but stable in the long term

#### 2. Systems thinking

**Partial Optimization vs. Overall Optimization**

Partial optimization problems:

- Narrowing of the field of view due to specialization
- Optimization of subsystems leads to overall de-optimization

Overall Optimal Needs:

- Integrative perspective
- Understanding
interactions - Feedback loop design

#### 3. Redundancy and Robustness

**Efficiency vs. Robustness**

Efficiency-Focused Vulnerabilities:

- Just-in-time production: Failure
in case of disaster - Dependence on a single power source: paralyzed in the event of a power outage

Robustness Design:

- Redundancy: Backup system
- Diversity: Multiple choices
- Decentralization: Spread risk

#### 4. adaptability

**Fixed vs Soft**

Fixed system problems:

- Inability to
respond to environmental changes - Unexpectedly fragile

Advantages of adaptive systems:

- Adapt to
change - Learn
and evolve - Deal with unexpected situations

### Specific Examples of Structures

#### Ocean Breathing System

**Structural Features:**

1. **Long-Term Perspective**

- Climate stabilization on a 100-year scale

1. **Systems Thinking**

- Consideration
of the entire ocean cycle - Integration of energy, nutrients, and CO2

1. **Verbosity**

- Combined power generation
of solar, wind, and tidal power - Even if one unit fails, the whole unit is functional.

1. **Adaptability**

• Modular design
• Scalable
in stages • Room for improvement

**Result:**

- Sustainable climate stabilization systems
- Reproducible hope structures

-----

## 1.6 Integration of the Four Principles

### Interrelationships

The four principles are not independent, but mutually supportive:

```
Providence: Foundation (Laws of Nature)
↓
Harmony: Relationship (Balance)
↓
Circulation: Dynamics (Flow)
↓
Structure: Design (Sustainability)
↓
Return to Providence
```

### Integration Practices

**Implementation in the Ocean Breathing System:**

1. **Providence**: Understanding and imitating the natural cycles of the
oceans1. **Harmony**: Harmony between man and nature, symbiosis
between technology and ecosystem1. **Circulation**: Restores
the cycle of nutrients, CO2, and energy1. **Structure**: Long-term stable design, repeatable hope

-----

## 1.7 Conclusion

The four principles of human survival are:

1. **Providence**: Understanding and Following the Laws of
Nature 1. **Harmony**: Maintaining a balance with nature, society, and
self1. **Recycling**: Circulating
resources and energy1. **Structure**: Designing a long-term stable system

By practicing these things, a sustainable civilization will be realized.

# Chapter 2: Auxiliary Principles and Practices

-----

## 2.1 Positioning of Subsidiary Principles

The four principles (providence, harmony, circulation, and structure) are the foundation of human existence, but more specific guidelines are needed to put them into practice.

The auxiliary principles presented in this chapter are specifically intended to embody the principle of "harmony" and translate it into everyday practice.

-----

### The Five Pillars of the Subsidiary Principle

```
1. 自然への理解（Understanding Nature）
2. 共存共栄（Coexistence & Co-prosperity）
3. 他利共生（Altruistic Symbiosis）
4. 多様性（Diversity）
5. 寛容さ（Tolerance）
```

These are not independent principles, but are organically linked under the big umbrella of "harmony".

-----

## 2.2 First Auxiliary Principle: Understanding Nature

### Definitions

**Understanding nature is to deeply study and recognize the mechanisms, laws, and providences of nature. **

This is a prerequisite for practicing providence.

### Why Understanding is Necessary

#### Destruction Caused by Ignorance

**Historical Examples:**

1. **The Tragedy of DDT**

- 1940s-60s: Used
as a breakthrough insecticide - Lack of understanding: There was no
concept of bioaccumulation - Consequences: Mass death of birds, destruction
of ecosystems - Lesson: The dangers of partial understanding

1. **Lessons from CFCQs**

- 1930s-80s: Spread
as an ideal refrigerant - Lack of understanding: Failure to predict effects on the ozone layer
- Consequences: Ozone hole occurrence
- Lessons learned: The importance of predicting long-term effects

1. **Fossil Fuel Blind Spots**

- Post-Industrial Revolution: Energy Revolution
- Lack of Understanding: Impact
on the Carbon Cycle - Consequences: Climate Change
- Lessons Learned: The Need for a Global Perspective

### Deepening Your Understanding

#### Level 1: Surface Understanding

**Level of "Knowing"**

- Memorization
of facts - Superficial causality
- Single point of view

**Example:**

- "If CO2 increases, it will warm"
- "If forests decrease, it will be a problem"

#### Level 2: Understanding the Mechanism

** "Know" level **

- Understanding
the mechanism - Multiple causal relationships
- Systems perspective

**Example:**

- "CO2 absorbs infrared rays and traps heat"
- "Forests absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and release oxygen"

#### Level 3: Integrative Understanding

**Visible level**

- Get
the big picture - Understand
interactions - Predict long-term effects

**Example:**

- "Fossil fuel burning → CO2 increase → Global warming → Rising sea surface temperature → Vertical circulation stoppage → Plankton decrease → CO2 absorption → Accelerated warming"
- "Deforestation → CO2 absorption decrease + soil runoff → River pollution → Marine eutrophication → Red tide → Fish population decline → Food chain collapse"

### Understanding in Practice

#### Observation

**Observing Nature Directly**

- Feel the change of
seasons - See
the activities of living things - Notice climate changes

**Effect:**

- Acquisition
of intuitive understanding - Sharpening of sensibilities
- Respect for nature

#### Learning

**Learn Scientific Knowledge**

- Ecology
- Climatology
- Earth Science
- Systems Thinking

**Effect:**

- Gain
logical understanding - Improve
your predictive skills - Foundation for problem solving

#### Integration

**Integrating Observation and Learning**

- Combining
experience and knowledge - Intuition and logic -
Grasping the big picture

**Effect:**

- Gain
a deep understanding - Make wise decisions
- Sustainable behavior

-----

## 2.3 The second auxiliary principle: coexistence and co-prosperity

### Definitions

**Coexistence and co-prosperity means living together with nature and others, and prospering together. **

It means building a win-win relationship, not a zero-sum game (someone's win is someone's loss).

### Conventional Thought Patterns

#### Domination and conquest

**The Paradigm of Modern Western Civilization**

```
Human > Natural
Strong > Weak
Developed Countries > Developing Countries
```

**Result:**

- Environmental destruction
- Widening
inequality - Intensification
of conflict - Unsustainable

#### Competition and Selection

**The Logic of Capitalism**

```
Competition → Winners and Losers
→ Efficient
Growth → Infinite Expansion
```

**Problem:**

- Infinite growth is impossible
on a finite earth - Truncation
of losers - Ignoring environmental costs

### New Thought Patterns

#### Symbiosis and Cooperative Type

**The Paradigm of Sustainable Civilization**

```
Human ⇄ Nature (interdependence)
Strong ⇄ Weak (mutual support)
Advanced countries ⇄ Developing countries (mutual cooperation)
```

**Result:**

- Environmental conservation
- Reducing
inequality - Promoting
cooperation - Sustainability

### Practice of Coexistence and Co-Prosperity

#### 1. Coexistence and co-prosperity with nature

**Traditional Farming Wisdom**

- Crop rotation: Give the soil a rest
- Mixed cropping: Reduce
pests and diseases - Compost: Create a cycle

**Integration with Modern Technology**

- Agroforestry: Forest and agriculture merge
- Permaculture: Permaculture
- Natural farming: Harnessing the power of nature

**Ocean Breathing Systemの例**

- Mimicking
the vertical cycle of nature - Collaboration between man and nature
- Coexistence
with marine ecosystems - Result: Both sides prosper

#### 2. Coexistence and co-prosperity between humans

**International cooperation**

So far:

- Competition
for resources - zero-sum game
- confrontation and war

New shape:

- Sharing of technology (open source)
- Sharing of knowledge (educational support)
- Equitable distribution
of resources - Result: Raising the overall level

**Economic System**

So far:

- Unilateral exploitation
- Concentration
of wealth - Widening inequality

New shape:

- Fair Trade
- Social Enterprise
- Basic Income
- Results: Sustainable Thriving

#### 3. Coexistence and co-prosperity between generations

**The Responsibilities of the Current Generation**

- Leave
no debt to the next generation - Preserve and pass on the environment
- Build a sustainable system

**The Rights of Future Generations**

- Clean air and water
- Stable climate
- Abundant nature
- Freedom of choice

-----

## 2.4 The third subsidy principle: symbiosis between others and interests

### Definitions

**Altruism is the idea of making the interests of others your own. **

It means going beyond selfishness and building a relationship in which altruism is ultimately self-interested.

### Limits of Selfishness

#### Short-term egoism

**"I just need to be good"**

- Profit even if you destroy
the environment - Grow at the expense of others
- Enjoy the present without caring about the future

**Result:**

- Tragedy
of the common land - prisoner's
dilemma - total collapse

#### Long-term egoism

**"For my future self"**

- Conserve the environment (secure resources in the future)
- Collaborate with others (secure future cooperation)
- Pursue sustainability (secure future stability)

**Problem:**

- Still self-centered
- Only
computable - Unexpectedly vulnerable

### The idea of symbiosis

#### Basic Concepts

**"The happiness of others is the happiness of oneself"**

This is:

- Values
, not calculations - Gifts
, not exchanges - Unconditional, not conditions

#### Altruism in the Natural World

**Examples of Symbiosis**

1. **Rhizodia and Plants**

- Rhizombies: Provide
nitrogen fixation - Plants: Provide
sugars - Result: Both survive and thrive

1. **Gut Bacteria and Humans**

- Bacteria: Aid
digestion - Humans: Provide
shelter and nourishment - Result: Healthy symbiosis

1. **Corals and zooxanthellae**

- Zooxanthellae: Provides nutrients through photosynthesis
- Corals: Provides protection and inorganic nutrients
- Results: Rich coral reefs

**Common feature:**

- Win-Win Relationship
- Interdependence
- Prosperity of the whole

### Practice of Altruism

#### Individual Level

**Everyday Practice**

- Volunteer activities
- Free knowledge sharing
- Support
for those in need - Environmental conservation activities

**Preparedness**

- Don't
expect anything in return - Feel
pleasure - Feel connected

#### Social Level

**Institutional Design**

- Universal healthcare: everyone's health is the benefit
of the whole - Public education: everyone's education is the development
of society - Social security: Protection of the weakest is social stability

**Corporate Activities**

So far:

- Maximizing
shareholder interests - Short-term profit pursuit

New shape:

- Emphasis
on stakeholders - Social value creation
- Consideration
for the environment - B Corporation (public interest enterprise)

#### International Level

**Opening up technology**

- Open source software
- Patent waiver of drugs (COVID-19 vaccines)
- Sharing renewable energy technologies

**Example of this declaration: Ocean Breathing System**

- Waiver
of patent rights - Free disclosure
of knowledge - Sharing of improvements -
Result: the benefit of humanity as a whole

-----

## 2.5 Fourth Subsidiary Principle: Diversity

### Definitions

Diversity is about acknowledging and respecting different beings, values, and cultures. **

It means diversity rather than uniformity, plurality rather than singularity, and heterogeneity rather than homogeneity.

### Importance of Diversity

#### Biological Diversity

**Ecosystem Stability**

```
Ecosystems with high diversity:
- Some species become extinct but remain intact
- Easily
adapt to environmental changes - Prevent the spread of diseases

Ecosystems with low diversity:
- Entire collapse due to extinction
of some species - Vulnerable
to environmental change - Prone to disease spread
```

**Historical Lessons:**

- Potato famine in Ireland (1845-1849)
- dependence
on a single variety - annihilation
by plague - starvation of more than a million people

#### Cultural Diversity

**Human Abundance**

Different cultures are:

- Have
different wisdom - Have
different solutions - Have different beauty

**Example:**

- The wisdom of indigenous peoples to coexist with nature
- Climate adaptation technologies
in each region - Diverse art, music, and literature

#### Technological Versatility

**A Source of Innovation**

Single Approach:

- No
way to fight when you get stuck - Concentration of risk

Diverse Approaches:

- Multiple solutions
- Risk distribution
- Mutual learning and evolution

-----

## 2.6 Fifth Auxiliary Principle: Tolerance

### Definitions

Tolerance is about tolerating and accepting things that are different from oneself. **

It means inclusion rather than exclusion, understanding rather than aggression, and coexistence rather than domination.

### What Intolerance Brings

#### Historical Tragedy

1. **Wars of religion**

- Intolerance of different faiths
- Centuries of killing

1. **Racism**

- Intolerance to skin color
- Slavery, genocide and discrimination

1. **Ideological Repression**

- Intolerance of different ideas
- Speech control, purge

#### Modern Intolerance

- Hate speech
- xenophobia
- fundamentalism
- partisan conflict

**Result:**

- Social division
- intensification
of conflict - chain
of violence - inability to solve problems

### Practicing Tolerance

#### Individual Level

**Responding to Differing Opinions**

Intolerance:

- Decide that it is "wrong"
- Reject an argument
- Attack

Tolerance:

- Admit that "there is such a point of view"
- Try to have a dialogue
- Try to understand

#### Social Level

**Institutional Design**

- Guarantee
of freedom of speech - Protection
of minority rights - Respect
for diversity - Creation of forums for dialogue

#### Setting Limits

**The Paradox of Tolerance**

Tolerance for intolerance is:

- Allow intolerance to spread
- Invite the destruction of a tolerant society

**Teachings of Carl Popper:**

"In order to maintain a tolerant society, we must be intolerant of intolerance."

**Practice:**

- Respect diversity -
do not
tolerate violence - do not
tolerate discrimination - ask for dialogue if you refuse to talk

-----

## 2.7 Integration of Subsidiary Principles

of criticism - Welcome improvement proposals

-----

## 2.9 Conclusion

The five pillars of the auxiliary principles are:

1. **Understanding Nature**: Learning
Providence1. **Coexistence and Co-Prosperity**: Thriving
Together1. **Symbiosis**: Wishing
for the happiness of others1. **Diversity**: Acknowledging
the Differences1. **Tolerance**: Embracing the Different

These are concrete practices of "harmony" and daily guidelines for building a sustainable civilization.

# Chapter 3: Analysis of Problems in Current Civilization

-----

## 3.1 Perception of the Status Quo of Civilization

Mankind is now building the most advanced technological civilization in history.

But at the same time, we are facing the biggest environmental crisis in history.

This chapter analyzes how modern civilization deviates from the four principles and reveals its root causes.

-----

## 3.2 Deviation from Providence

### 3.2.1 The Idea of Natural Dominance

#### Merits and Demerits of Modern Science

**功績：**

- Understanding
natural phenomena - Technological
breakthroughs - Improving
living standards - Extending life expectancy

**罪過：**

- Arrogance
that "you can control nature" - Establishment
of "anthropocentrism" - Loss of reverence for nature

**Words of Francis Bacon (1620):**

"Knowledge is power, conquer nature."

This idea became the foundation of modern civilization, but it was also the ideological root of environmental destruction.

### 3.2.2 Ignoring the Second Law of Thermodynamics

#### Law of Entropy Increase

**Nature's Providence:**

```
Order → Disorder (increased entropy)
Concentrated → Diffusion
Available Energy → Heat (Unavailable)
```

This is the fundamental law of the universe and cannot be violated.

#### The Illusion of Human Civilization

**The illusion of "infinite growth"**

Assumptions of Economics:

- GDP growth rate: 2-3%
per year - Compound interest: exponential growth
- Assumptions: Resources are infinite, the environment is infinite

**Reality:**

- The earth is finite
- Resources are finite
- Environmental capacity is finite

**Mathematical Inevitability:**

```
Exponential growth is impossible
in a finite system ↓
will definitely reach
the limit ↓
collapse or steady state
```

### 3.2.3 Disruption of the Carbon Cycle

#### Natural Carbon Cycle

**Stability over the past million years:**

```
Atmospheric CO2: 180-280 ppm
Fluctuation range: 100 ppm
Period: 100,000 years (glacial cycle)
Temperature change: about 6°C
```

In this gradual fluctuation, humanity evolved and built civilization.

#### 人為的破壊（産業革命以降）

**Current Status (2025):**

```
Atmospheric CO2: 425-430 ppm
Increase: 150 ppm (in just 250 years)
Rate of increase: more than
100 times Predicted temperature rise: 2-4°C (already 1.5°C increase)
```

**The Essence of the Matter:**

Natural Carbon Cycle:

```
Photosynthesis (absorption) ⇄ Respiration and decomposition (release)
↓
balanced (±0)
```

Man-made destruction:

```
Fossil fuel combustion: 40 billion tons of CO2 emissions per
year Deforestation: loss
of sinks, net
increase
of about 20 billion tons per year, cumulative
450 ppm is only a matter of time
```

### 3.2.4 Disruption of the Water Cycle

#### Groundwater Depletion

**Major Aquifers in the World:**

- Ogarara Aquifer, USA: 30-50% decrease
over the past 50 years - North China Plain: 1-3m water level decrease
per year - Ganges Basin, India: Salinization due to over-pumping

**Issue:**

- Charge rate << Pumping speed
- Depletion
of water accumulated over thousands of years in decades - Irreversible land subsidence

#### Blocking River Flow

**Dams of the World:**

- Total number: Approximately 50,000 or more
- Large dams: Approximately 5,000
- Impact: Approximately 60% of rivers are divided

**Ecological Impact:**

- Extinction
of migratory fish - Sediment deposition (downstream coastal erosion)
- Shrinking
estuarine delta - Interruption of the supply of nutrients to the ocean

-----

## 3.3 Deviation from Harmony

### 3.3.1 Disharmony with Nature

#### Heat Island Phenomenon

**Disruption of Urban Heat Balance:**

Conventional (natural state):

```
Solar energy
↓
absorption
by the earth's surface ↓
cooling
by evaporation and plant transpiration ↓
heat circulation
```

Present (urbanization):

```
Solar energy
↓
absorbed
by asphalt and concrete ↓
heat storage (no cooling by evaporation)
↓
heat radiation
until night ↓
urban areas are 5-10°C hotter than the surrounding area
```

**Result:**

- Increasing demand for air conditioners → Increasing electricity consumption → Increasing
CO2 emissions - Increasing
heat stroke - Frequent guerrilla
downpours - Changes in ecosystems

#### Expansion of Ocean Dead Zones

**Mechanism:**

```
1. Global warming
↓
2. Sea surface temperature rise
↓
3. Stratification (strengthening the separation of surface and deep layers)
↓
4. Stopping
the vertical circulation ↓
5. Nutrients in the deep layer do not
reach the surface layer ↓
6. Decrease
in surface plankton↓
7. Decrease
in CO2 absorption capacity ↓
8. Further warming (vicious circle)
```

At the same time:

```
5. Deep oxygen supply stopped
↓
6. Anaerobic
in the deep layer↓
7. Death of living
things ↓
Formation of dead zones
```

**Status quo:**

- Ocean dead zones in the world: about 500 or more
- Area: about 240,000 km² (about the size of Honshu, Japan)
- Expansion rate: accelerating year by year

### 3.3.2 Social Disharmony

#### Growing Economic Disparities

**Current Status (2025):**

- The top 1% of the wealthy hold about 45% of the world's wealth
- The bottom 50% of people hold only about 2% of the world's wealth
- Gini coefficient: above 0.4 in many countries (inequality warning line)

**Issue:**

- Social instability
- Inequality
of opportunity- Health disparities
- Education disparities
- Fixation of generational disparities

#### International Conflicts

**Conflict Over Resources:**

- Water resources (Nile, Mekong River, etc.)
- Energy resources (oil, natural gas)
- Rare metals and rare earths
- Fishery resources

**Climate Responsibility:**

- Historical emitters vs. current emitters
- Developed vs. developing countries
- Conflict over the burden of countermeasure costs

### 3.3.3 Personal Disharmony

#### Mental Health Crisis

**Pathology in modern society:**

Depression and anxiety disorders:

- WHO estimates: More than
300 million people worldwide - Increasing trend
in developed countries - Rapid increase in young people

Suicide:

- Approximately 700,000 people per year (WHO statistics)
- Japan: Approximately 20,000 per year (decreasing but still high)

Death from overwork and suicide from overwork:

- International attention
as a problem unique to Japan - Normalization of long working hours

**Root Cause:**

- Excessive stress
in a competitive society - Dilution of human
relationships - Loss
of meaning in life - Loss of connection with nature

-----

## 3.4 Deviation from the Circulation

### 3.4.1 Linear Economic Systems

#### "Gathering→ Production→ Consumption→ Disposal" Model

**Basic Structure of the Modern Economy:**

```
1. Resource extraction (mines, oil fields, forests, etc.)
↓
2. Mass production (factory)
↓
3. Mass consumption (market)
↓
4. Mass disposal (garbage)
↓
end (no recycling)
```

**Problem:**

Entrance Problems:

- Depletion
of resources - Environmental destruction
by mining - Energy consumption

Exit problems:

- Waste accumulation
- Environmental pollution
- CO2 emissions

### 3.4.2 The Tragedy of Plastics

#### Production and Disposal

**Status quo:**

- Annual production: about 400 million tons
- Cumulative production (1950-2020): about 10 billion tons
- Recycling rate: only 9%
- Incineration: 12%
- Landfill and environmental release: 79%

**Marine Plastic Pollution:**

- Annual inflow: about 8 million tons
- Cumulative volume: about 150 million tons
- Microplastics: spread
all over the planet - Bioconcentration: Food chain to the human body

**The Essence of the Matter:**

- Does not decompose (remains for hundreds of years)
- Does not
circulate - Accumulates

### 3.4.3 Linearization of Food Systems

#### Traditional Circular Agriculture

```
Crops → Food → Excrement → Compost → Farmland → Crops
↓
Full Cycle
```

**Japan in the Edo Period:**

- Transporting
urban waste to rural areas - Used
as fertilizer - Almost 100% nutrient cycling

#### Modern Linear Agriculture

```
Chemical fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium)
↓
Input
into farmland ↓
Crop production
↓
Transportation
to cities ↓
Consumption
↓
Sewage treatment → Discharge
↓
End (no circulation)
```

**Problem:**

Nitrogen Excess

- Excessive input
of chemical fertilizers - Flowing
into rivers and oceans - Eutrophication → Red tides and dead zones

Phosphorus depletion:

- Phosphate ore is a finite resource
- Recoverable life: about 100 years
- No substitution (phosphorus is essential for life)

-----

## 3.5 Deviations from the Structure

### 3.5.1 Dominance of Short-Term Thinking

#### Shortening of Politics

**The Negative Effects of the Election Cycle:**

- Term: 2-6 years
- Perspective: Until
the next election - Policy: Prioritize short-term effects

**Result:**

- Postponement
of long-term problems - Repeated
symptomatic treatment - Abandonment of structural reforms

**Example: Climate Action**

Necessary measures:

- 50-100 Year Perspective
- Short-term Cost Burden
- Long-Term Benefit

Political Reality:

- Elections in four years are prioritized
- Focus
on short-term interests of voters - Postpone measures

#### Shortening of the Economy

**The Curse of Quarterly Earnings:**

- Reporting Cycle: 3 Months
- Perspective: Next Quarter
- Valuation: Short-Term Profit

**Result:**

- Reduced
long-term investment - Reduced
R&D expenditure - Ignoring environmental costs

### 3.5.2 The Partial Optimal Trap

#### Merits and Drawbacks of Specialization

**功績：**

- Deep expertise
- Technological sophistication
- Increased efficiency

**罪過：**

- narrowing
of the field of vision - lack of
integrative thinking - loss of the big picture

**Example: Breaking Down Global Warming Countermeasures**

Energy Experts:

- "We should increase renewable energy"

Forest experts:

- "We should increase the number of forests."

Marine Experts:

- "You can use the absorption power of the ocean"

**Issue:**

- Each is correct
- but not
integrated - interaction is not
visible - does not lead to overall optimum

### 3.5.3 Vulnerable Structures

#### Just-in-time の脆弱性

**Efficiency-Focused Design:**

```
Zero inventory → Cost reduction
↓
However
↓ in
times of
disaster and pandemic ↓
supply chain disruption
↓
social function shutdown
```

**Real-Life Example: COVID-19 Pandemic**

- Shortage of
masks - Shortage
of medical supplies - Shortage
of semiconductors - Shortage of food

**Lesson:**

- Efficiency ≠ Robustness
- Need for
Redundancy - Importance of Backups

#### Dangers of Single Power Dependency

**Modern Society's Dependence on Electricity:**

```
Everything runs
on electricity ↓
power
outage ↓
social paralysis
```

**Illustration:**

- Hokkaido Blackout (2018)
- Great Texas Power Outage (2021)
- California Planned Power Outage (2019-)

**Structure of the Problem:**

- Centralized power supply
- Lack of
backup - Delayed decentralization

-----

## 3.6 Root Cause Analysis

### 3.6.1 Roots of Thought

#### Anthropocentrism

**Basic Idea:**

- Humans are the center
of all things - Nature exists
for humans - Human interests come first

**Result:**

- Instrumentalization
of nature - Justification
of environmental destruction - Neglect of other life

#### Growth supremacy

**Basic Idea:**

- Growth is good
- GDP growth is happiness
- Expansion is progress

**Result:**

- Pursuit of infinite growth (on a finite Earth)
- Externalization
of environmental costs - Ignoring unsustainability

#### Individualism and selfishness

**Basic Idea:**

- Personal freedom comes first
- Maximizing
self-interest - Indifference to others and society

**Result:**

- Neglect
of public goods - Tragedy
of common lands - Loss of social solidarity

### 3.6.2 Systematic Causes

#### Market Failure

**Ignoring External Uneconomy:**

```
Corporate profit calculation:
Income - Cost = Profit
↓
What is not included in the cost:
- Cost of environmental destruction
- Cost
of climate change - Cost
of health damage - Cost
to future generations ↓
These are
"externalized" ↓
the burden of society as a whole
```

**The Problem of Discount Rates:**

```
Present value = future value / (1 + r)^t

r = discount rate (usually 3-5%)
t = number of years

Example: r=5%, t=1 million yen in 100 years
in the future = about 760 yen
now ↓
100 million yen loss in 100 years = 76,000 yen
now ↓
huge losses in the future are underestimated
```

#### Limitations of Democracy

**The Principle of Majority Rule:**

Advantage:

- Reflecting
the majority opinion - Decentralization of power

Limit:

- Minority rights
- Rights of future generations (no voting rights)
- Disregard for expertise (populism)
- Prioritization of short-term interests

### 3.6.3 Knowledge Fragmentation

#### Growing Specialization

**Modern Science Developments:**

```
17th century: Universal scholar (all-rounder)
↓
19th century: Establishment
of specialties ↓
20th century: Further subdivision
↓
21st century: Super-specialization
```

**Result:**

- Deep knowledge (vertical)
- Narrow field of view (lack of horizontality)
- Difficulty integrating

#### Loss of Integrative Perspective

**Issue:**

Complex issues (climate change, environmental destruction, etc.) are:

- Spanning multiple disciplines
- Interaction is important
- Need to see the big picture

However:

- Experts only
in their own field - no
one to integrate - not overall optimal

-----

## 3.7 Crossroads of Civilization

### 3.7.1 Precursors of Collapse

**Historical Patterns:**

The collapse of civilization is not sudden, there are signs:

1. **Resource Depletion**
**Environmental Degradation**
1. **Social Destabilization**
1. **The division between the elite and the masses**
1. **The Dominance of Short-Term Thinking**
1. **Ignoring Warnings**
1. **Collapse**

**The Current State of Modern Civilization:**

1. ✓ Signs of resource depletion (oil peak, water shortage, etc.)
1. ✓ Environmental degradation (climate change, biodiversity loss, etc.)
1. ✓ Social instability (widening inequality, political division, etc.)
1. ✓ Growing
divisions1. ✓ Domination
of short-term thinking1. ✓ Ignoring warnings (e.g., IPCC reports)
1. **？ ** (still avoidable)

### 3.7.2 Time Out Crisis

**Master Reasoning (detailed in Part 3):**

```
Time left: Approximately 5 years (2025-2030)
↓
Reason: Time lag (20-30 years)
↓
Start
in 2030 ↓
2050-2060
↓
Will it be in time at the last minute?
```

**However:**

```
Start
in 2035 ↓
The effect will not be effective until 2055-2065
↓
It is too late
```

-----

## 3.8 Possibility of Hope

### 3.8.1 Changing Perceptions

**Pessimistic Reality Perception:**

The problem is serious. Time is limited.

**However:**

Recognizing the problem is the first step towards solving it.

### 3.8.2 Possibilities of Technology

**Ocean Breathing System の例：**

- Technologically feasible
- Economically sustainable
- Ecologically sound
- Deployable on a large scale

**Other Techniques:**

- Renewable energy
- Circular agriculture
- Urban redesign
- All feasible

### 3.8.3 Hope of Construction

Hope is not an emotion, but a structure. **

You will need:

1. Return
to the Four Principles1. Practice
of the Subsidiary Principle1. Technology Implementation1
. Redesign the system

These are not "can't", but just "don't".

-----

## 3.9 Conclusion

Modern civilization has seriously deviated from four principles:

1. **Ignoring Providence**: Neglecting
the Laws of Nature1. **Loss of Harmony**: Disharmony with Nature, Society, and
Self1. **Disrupting the Cycle**: The Dominance of
Linear Systems 1. **Lack of Structure**: Short-term thinking, partial optimization, vulnerability

The root cause is:

- Ideological: anthropocentrism, growth supremacy, selfishness
- Systemic: market failure, limits of democracy
- Intellectual: specialization, lack of integration

However:

- The problem is being recognized
- The technical solution exists
- There is potential for change

The time left is limited, but it is still in time.

In the next part III, we will further deepen our understanding of the current situation and clarify the nonlinear progression and urgency of global warming.

# Part III: Recognition of the Status Quo

## -Nonlinear Progression and Urgency of Global Warming-

# Chapter 4: Comparison with IPCC Models

-----

## 4.1 Current CO2 Concentrations

### Observational data for October 2025

**Atmospheric CO2 Concentration:**

```
As of October 2025: Approximately 425-430 ppm (0.0425-0.043%)

Detailed Data (NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory):
- August 2025: 425.48 ppm
- May 2025 (seasonal peak): 430.5 ppm
- 2024 average: 422.5 ppm
- Annual increase: about 3 ppm (compared to 2024)
```

### Historical Context

**Fluctuations over the past 800,000 years:**

```
氷期：約180 ppm
間氷期：約280 ppm
変動幅：約100 ppm
周期：約10万年
```

**Pre-Industrial Revolution (c. 1750):**

```
Approx. 280 ppm
```

**Present (2025):**

```
425-430 ppm
↓
Pre-Industrial Revolution: +145-150 ppm
1.5 times the natural variation range: in just 275 years
```

### Anomaly of the rate of increase

**Natural Speed of Change:**

```
Glacial → interglacial (100 ppm increase): about 5,000-10,000 years
↓
Rate of increase: 0.01-0.02 ppm/year
```

**Artificial Speed of Change:**

```
Industrial Revolution ~ Present (150 ppm increase): about 275 years
↓
Increase rate: about 0.5 ppm/year (initial)
↓
Present: 2-3 ppm/year
↓
100-300 times natural
```

-----

## 4.2 IPCC Prediction Model

### 4.2.1 Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, 2021-2023)

**Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP)シナリオ：**

#### SSP1-1.9 (Best Case Scenario)

```
Assumptions:
- Immediate and strict emission reductions
- Net zero by
2050 - Large-scale reforestation
- Implementation of carbon capture technologies

CO2 concentration in 2100:
about 350-450 ppm (below today)

Temperature rise:
+1.5°C or less (compared to pre-industrial revolution)
```

#### SSP2-4.5 (Intermediate Scenario)

```
Assumptions:
- Phased emissions reductions
- Net zero
around 2070 - An extension of current policies

CO2 concentration at 2100:
about 550-650 ppm

Temperature rise:
+2.5-3 ° C
```

#### SSP3-7.0 (High Emission Scenario)

```
Assumptions:
- Moderate emission reduction
- Continued
dependence on fossil fuels - Limited international cooperation

CO2 concentration at 2100:
about 800-900 ppm

Temperature rise:
+3.5-4.5 ° C
```

#### SSP5-8.5 (Worst Case Scenario)

```
Assumptions:
- No
emissions reductions - Increased
fossil fuel use - Economic growth priority

CO2 concentration at 2100:
about 1100-1200 ppm

Temperature rise:
above +4.5-5.5 ° C
```

### 4.2.2 Assumptions of the IPCC Model

**Basic Assumptions:**

1. **Linearity Assumptions**

- Emissions and concentrations are proportional
- Feedback is
limited - Tipping points are considered but modest

1. **Sink Stability**

- Forest CO2 uptake: almost maintained
- Ocean CO2 uptake: gradually decreasing
- Soil carbon storage: slightly reduced

1. **Policy Optimism**

- International cooperation functions
- Technology development is smooth
- Social consensus building is possible

-----

## 4.3 Master Reasoning (Nonlinear Prediction)

### 4.3.1 Differences in Basic Assumptions

**IPCC Model:**

```
Linear thinking
↓
Extension
of current trend ↓
Sink almost maintained
```

**Master Reasoning:**

```
Nonlinear thinking
↓
acceleration
at tipping point ↓
sink decay and conversion to emission source.
```

### 4.3.2 Prediction of Master Inference

**Predicting CO2 Concentrations:**

```
2025: 425-430 ppm (current status)
2030: 450-470 ppm
2040: 520-550 ppm 2050
: 600 ppm (0.06%) 2060
: 700 ppm (0.07%) 2070
: 900 ppm (0.09%)
2090: 1200 ppm (0.12%)
2100: 1300-1500 ppm
```

**Compare:**

```
IPCC worst-case scenario (SSP5-8.5):
1100-1200 ppm in 2100

Master inference:
1200 ppm in 2090 (10 years earlier) 1300-1500
ppm in 2100 (worse)
```

### 4.3.3 Mechanism of Acceleration

**Why Accelerate:**

#### 1. Reduction of sinks

**Forest:**

```
Traditional: CO2 sink (absorbs about 1.5 billion tons per year)
↓
Present: Absorption capacity decreases
↓
Near-future: Neutralization
↓
Future: Conversion to emission source
```

**Ocean:**

```
Conventional: CO2 sinks (absorbed about 2.5 billion tons per year)
↓
Effects of global warming:
- Rising sea surface temperature → Decrease
in solubility - Strengthening stratification → Cessation
of vertical circulation - Decrease in plankton → Decrease
in photosynthesis ↓
Absorption capacity: Decrease
↓
Around 2050: 50% decline possible
```

#### 2. New sources of emission

**Permafrost:**

```
Area: Approximately 24 million km² (approximately 24% of the Earth's landmass)
Stored carbon: Approximately 1,700 gigatons
↓
Melting
due to global warming ↓
Methane and CO2 emissions
↓
Methane greenhouse effect: Approximately 28 times CO2 (100-year scale)
↓
Acceleration of the index
```

**Forest Fires:**

```
Previously: Approximately 2 billion tons of CO2 emissions per year (natural fires)
↓
Increase due to global warming:
- Drying → Increased
flammability - Heat waves → Increased
risk of ignition - Forest stress → Increase

## 4.4 Validating Predictions

### 4.4.1 Historical Similarities

**Past Rapid Warming Events:**

#### PETM（Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum）

```
When: about 56 million years ago
Duration: about 200,000 years
CO2 increase: unknown (estimated 1000-3000 ppm)
Temperature rise: 5-8°C (global average)
Mechanism: Mass release of methane hydrate (hypothesis)
↓
Mass extinction: about 50% of marine life
↓
Recovery: Approximately 100,000 years or more
```

**Lesson:**

- Rapid CO2 increase → Large-scale climate change
- Positive feedback → Accelerated change
- Extremely long period of time for recovery

#### Rapid warming at the end of the last glacial period

```
When: about 15,000-11,000 years ago
CO2 increase: about 100 ppm (180→280) Temperature
rise: about 6°C (global average)
Duration: about 4,000 years
↓
But the current rate is much faster than this
```

### 4.4.2 Lessons from the Glacial and Interglacial Cycles

**Data from the past 800,000 years:**

```
CO2 fluctuation: 180-280 ppm (100 ppm width)
Temperature fluctuation: about 6°C
↓
CO2 100 ppm fluctuation ≈ Temperature fluctuation
6°C ↓
i.e.
↓ CO2
sensitivity: about 0.06°C/ppm
```

**Application to Current Situations:**

```
Pre-Industrial Revolution: 280 ppm
Current: 425 ppm
Increase: 145 ppm
↓
Predicted temperature rise: 145 × 0.06 = about 8.7°C
↓
But the current increase is only
about 1.5°C ↓
Why?
```

**Answer: Time Lag**

```
CO2 increase → Why warming takes time
:
- Ocean thermal inertia (huge heat capacity)
- Melting ice sheets (time required)
- Ecosystem response (delay)
↓
Estimated time lag: 20-30 years
↓
i.e.
↓
The current global warming is
the result
of CO2 increase 20-30 years ago ↓
There is a possibility of a further increase of 5-7°C in the
next 20-30 years
```

### 4.4.3 Consistency with Recent Observations

**2020-2025 anomalies:**

of about 3000-400 billion tons per year ↓
Accelerating
```

**Antarctic Ice Sheet:**

```
West Pole: Rapid Melting Middle
East Antarctica: Signs of Melting
↓

2023-2025:
- North Atlantic: Record high temperatures
- Pacific Ocean: El Niño + long-term warming
- Indian Ocean: Continuous heat waves
↓
Severe impact
on marine ecosystems ↓
Coral reefs: Large-scale bleaching
Fish: Change
in Distribution Plankton: Declining Trend

## 4.5 Limitations of the IPCC Model

### 4.5.1 Linearity Assumptions

**Problem:**

Climate systems are inherently nonlinear (chaotic system)
↓
unpredictable behavior in linear models
↓
rapid changes
at tipping points ↓
cannot be captured by conventional models

**The Discovery of Lorenz (1963):**

Weather is deterministic chaos
↓
Slight differences in initial conditions
↓
Unpredictable
results ↓
"Butterfly effect"

### 4.5.2 Underestimating Tipping Points

**IPCC Caution:**

Reason:

- Demands
for scientific certainty - Political considerations
- Conservative predictions

Result:

- Underestimation
of risk - Dilution
of urgency - Delay in action

**Changes in AR6:**

Previously: Tipping points are "possibility" AR6
: Tipping points are "real risks"
↓
Perceptions are changing, but they are still insufficient

### 4.5.3 Neglect of sink collapse

**IPCC Assumptions:**

Forest and marine absorption capacity:

- Gradually decline
- but maintained

**Reality:**

Amazon:

```
2021 study (Nature):
Some regions have already switched
to net emissions sources ↓
Possibility of crossing the tipping point
```

Ocean:

```
Expansion of dead zones: Accelerating
year by year Vertical circulation stoppage: Widely observed
Plankton decline: Ongoing
↓
Rapid decline in absorption capacity
```

## 4.6 Master Reasoning Advantage

### 4.6.1 Nonlinear Thinking

**Understanding the Earth System:**

```
Earth = complex adaptive system
↓
nonlinear interaction
↓
emergent behavior
↓
unpredictable but
↓
insight possible with integrated understanding
```

### 4.6.2 Providence and Circulation Perspectives

**IPCC Approach:**

```
Data → Model → Predictive
↓
Inductive and Empirical
```

**Master Approach:**

```
Understanding Providence → Mechanism Insights → Predictive
↓
Deductive and Integrative
```

**Example: Forest Fire Prediction**

IPCC：

```
Historical Data → Statistical Models → Predictions
```

Master:

```
Global warming → Arranging → Forest stress → Increasing
flammability ↓
Inevitable
increase in fires ↓
Further
↓
Fires → CO2 emissions → Acceleration of global warming (positive feedback)
↓
Exponential increase is inevitable
```

### 4.6.3 Integrating the Earth Perspective

## 4.7 Meaning of 600 ppm in 2050

### 4.7.1 Comparison with the Past

**600 ppm:**

```
Unprecedented
in the past 800,000 years ↓
Closest analogue:
PETM (56 million years ago)
↓
At that time: mass extinction
```

### 4.7.2 Effect on Temperature

**Estimated Temperature Rise:**

```
CO2 sensitivity: 0.06°C/ppm (from the glacial cycle)
↓
600 - 280 = 320 ppm increase
↓
320 × 0.06 = about 19°C increase?
```

**However:**

In the short term, there are mitigating factors:

- Heat absorption
in the ocean - Cooling
by melting ice sheets - Cooling effect of aerosols

**Realistic Predictions:**

```
2050 (600 ppm): +3-4°C
2100: +6-8°C
Equilibrium (after hundreds of years): +10-15°C
```

### 4.7.3 Ecosystem Impact

**+3-4°C World:**

```
Coral reefs: Nearly wiped out
Rainforests: Significantly shrinking or disappearing
Arctic: Summer ice loss
↓
50% of species are endangered (IPCC)
↓
Food chain collapse
↓
Human food crisis
```

-----

## 4.8 Conclusion

### IPCC Model vs Master Reasoning

**IPCC Model:**

- Linear Prediction
- Careful Assumptions
- Assuming
Sink Maintenance - 2100: 1100-1200 ppm (Worst)

**Master Reasoning:**

- Nonlinear prediction
- Considering
tipping points - Factoring in sink collapse
- 2090: 1200 ppm
- 2100: 1300-1500 ppm

### Conclusion

The master reasoning is:

- More realistic
- based on
mechanisms - consistent
with recent observations - more accurately reflects urgency

However:

- It's not
that there is no hope - If you act,
you can change - Consider the details of tipping points in the next chapter

In the next chapter, we will analyze the remaining time in more detail.

## 6.1 Understanding the Essence of Time

### 6.1.1 Three Time Axes

To understand climate change, we need to distinguish between three distinct time axes:

```
1. Time
of emissions - Time
to emit CO2 - Controllable by humans

2. Time
of accumulation - Time
of accumulation in the atmosphere - Lifespan of CO2: hundreds - thousands of years

3. Time to response (time lag)
- Time
for the climate system to respond - 20-30 years delay
```

### 6.1.2 The Importance of Time Lag

**The Most Overlooked Element:**

```
CO2 emissions
today ↓
not
today's warming ↓
global warming in 20-30 years
```

**Conversely:**

```
Today's warming
↓
Results of CO2 emissions 20-30 years ago
```

**Why Time Lag:**

1. **Thermal Inertia in the Ocean**

```
The ocean's enormous heat capacity
↓
It takes
time to warm up ↓
Heat is transmitted to the depths: decades
```

1. **Ice Sheet Response Time**

```
Melting ice sheets: slow progress
↓
Perfect equilibrium: hundreds to thousands of years
```

1. **Ecosystem Response**

```
Forest Change: Decades
Species Migration: Tens - Hundreds of Years
```

## 6.2 Rationale for "5 Years Grace"

### 6.2.1 Calculation Fundamentals

**Precondition:**

```
Goal: Avoiding
tipping point (+2°C) Status: +1.5°C (2025)
Margin: 0.5°C
Time lag: 20-30 years
```

**Backward:**

```
We want to
avoid +2°C in 2050 ↓
Considering
a time lag of 20-30 years ↓
We need to
start taking measures in 2020-2030 ↓
Currently 2025
↓
Remaining: about 5 years
```

### 6.2.2 More In-Depth Analysis

**The Relationship Between CO2 Concentration and Temperature:**

```
Pre-Industrial Revolution: 280 ppm → Current reference temperature
(2025): 425 ppm → +1.5°C ↓
1.5°C
increase by 145 ppm
↓
Sensitivity: about 0.01°C/ppm

Up to +2°C target:
0.5°C margin
↓
Allowable CO2 increase: approx. 50 ppm
↓
Target concentration: approx. 475 ppm
```

**Current Rate of Increase:**

```
Annual increase: 2-3 ppm
↓
to 475 ppm:
(475 - 425) / 2.5 = about 20 years
↓
Reach
around 2045 ↓
But time lag 20-30 years
↓
The temperature reaches +2°C in 2065-2075
```

**At first glance, it seems to be a lot of room:**

```
Problem 1: Nonlinear acceleration
- acceleration
at tipping point - no
guarantee that the current rate of increase of 2.5 ppm/year will be maintained - further acceleration due to reduced absorption capacity of forests and oceans

Problem 2: The time lag paradox
- even if
CO2 emissions are stopped in 2045 - warming will continue
until 2065-2075 - so measures must be started in 2025-2030 at the latest.
```

### 6.2.3 "2030 is a watershed"

**IPCC Special Report (2018):**

```
"To
limit it to +1.5°C, we need to reduce
CO2 emissions by 45% by 2030 compared to 2010 and achieve
net zero by 2050."
```

**Reality:**

```
Progress as of 2025:
- Compared to 2010: about 10% increase (not reduction, but increase)
- Net zero declaration: many countries have announced
- However, the effectiveness is questionable
```

**Consequently:**

```
+1.5°C target: Already almost impossible
↓
+2°C target: still possible, but time is
running out ↓
Large-scale measures must
be started by 2030 ↓
Current 2025
↓
Remaining: about 5 years
```

## 6.3 Timeline of Master Reasoning

### 6.3.1 Pessimistic Scenario (No Countermeasures)

**CO2 Concentration Trends:**

```
2025: 425 ppm (current)
2030: 450 ppm (+25, 5 ppm acceleration per year) 2035
: 480 ppm (+30, further acceleration)
2040: 520 ppm (+40, tipping effect)
2050: 600 ppm (+80, runaway
2060: 700 ppm (+100, out of control)
2070: 900 ppm (+200, catastrophic) 2090: 1200 ppm (+300, hell)

```

**Temperature Rise (Time Lag Consideration):**

```
2025: +1.5°C (current)
2030: +1.7°C
2040: +2.0°C (beyond tipping point)
2050: +2.5°C
2060: +3 .0°C
2070: +4.0°C (CO2 effect in 2050)
in 2080: +5.5°C (CO2 effect in 2060)
2100: +7-8°C (CO2 effect in 2070-80)
```

**Impact on Human Civilization:**

```
2030s:
- Normalization
of extreme weather events - Destabilization
of food production - Growing water crisis

2040s:
- Massive climate refugees (hundreds of millions)
- Frequent
conflicts - Economic system upset

2050s:
- Partial collapse
of civilization - Beginning
of population decline - Collapse of nations

After the 2060s:
- Drastic decline
in habitable areas - The very survival of mankind is in jeopardy
```

### 6.3.2 Desired Scenario (Implementation of Large-scale Measures)

**Precondition:**

```
2025-2030:
- Large-scale deployment of Ocean Breathing System (100,000 units)
- Rapid transition
to renewable energy - Reforestation program
- Implementation of carbon capture technology
```

**CO2 Concentration Trends:**

```
2025: 425 ppm (current)
2030: 440 ppm (+15, slowing down)
2035: 450 ppm (+10, slowing further)
2040: 455 ppm (+5, almost flat) 2050
: 450 ppm (-5, declining turn).
2060: 430 ppm (-20, stabilized)
2070: 410 ppm (-20, continued decline)
2100: 380 ppm (pre-industrial +100 ppm, acceptable)
```

**Temperature Rise (Time Lag Consideration):**

```
2025: +1.5°C (current situation)
2030: +1.7°C (still rising, time lag)
2040: +2.0°C (peak, lasting)
2050: +2.0°C (flat, countermeasure effect in the 2030s)
2060: +1.9°C (starting to decline, countermeasure effect in the 2040s)
2070: +1.7°C (stabilized) 2100
: +1.5°C (acceptable)
```

**Impact on Human Civilization:**

```
2030s:
- Impacts of climate change persist but manageable
- Transition
to a renewable energy economy - Start building sustainable social systems

2040s:
- Overcoming the peak of global
warming - Establishing
a recycling-oriented society - Starting to restore ecosystems

From the 2050s onwards:
- Stable climate
- Sustainable civilization
- Harmony with nature
```

### 6.3.3 The Divergence of the Two Scenarios

**Your choices for 2025-2030 will make it all matter:**

```
Large-scale measures to start
in 2025-2030 ↓
YES → Desired scenario
NO → Pessimistic scenario
↓
Difficult
to correct after the branch ↓
It is too late to start countermeasures after 2030
```

## 6.4 The Cruel Truth About Time Lag

### 6.4.1 The "Invisible Future" Problem

**Human Cognitive Biases:**

```
What is visible: The current state
What is not visible: The state
in 20-30 years ↓
The present is relatively stable
↓ Lack

of sense of crisis ↓
Delay
in countermeasures ↓
However
↓
The
world we can see in 20-30 years is already
determined by today's actions
```

**Analogy:**

```
Titanic

Iceberg discovery
↓
Turn the rudder
↓
But a huge ship ↓

does not turn immediately (inertia)
↓ time
lag
until collision ↓
early steering is essential for avoidance
```

### 6.4.2 "The Promised Global Warming"

**Warming already "promised":**

```
CO2 emissions
in the past 20-30 years ↓
Not
yet reflected in the climate system ↓
It will
become apparent in the next 20-30 years ↓
Even
if CO2 emissions are reduced to zero today ↓
Additional warming of about 0.3-0.5°C is inevitable
```

**Status quo:**

```
Current: +1.5°C
Promised warming: +0.3-0.5°C
↓
Total: +1.8-2.0°C
↓
Possibility of already reaching the tipping point (+2°C)
```

### 6.4.3 "Negative Legacy"

**Current Generation Emissions:**

```
Emissions
in 2025 ↓
Global warming
from 2045 to 2055 ↓
Furthermore
, ↓
CO2 lifespan: hundreds to thousands of years
↓
Affects generations hundreds of years from now
```

**Intergenerational Injustice:**

```
Benefits of emissions: Current generation enjoys
the burden of impact:
Ethical issues borne
by future generations
```

## 6.5 Step-by-Step Understanding of "Too Late"

### 6.5.1 Three "Too Late"

**Level 1: Too Late for Your Ideal Goal**

```
+1.5°C target
↓
already almost impossible (as of 2025)
↓
but not yet catastrophic
```

**Level 2: Too late to an acceptable goal**

```
+2°C target
↓
It is too late
to start countermeasures after 2030 ↓
Out
of control beyond the tipping point ↓
Present (2025): Just in time
```

**Level 3: It's too late to keep civilization alive**

```
+4-5°C or higher
↓
Difficulty
in sustaining human civilization ↓
It is too late
to start countermeasures after 2040 ↓
However, it is not
catastrophic ↓
Survival as a human species is possible
```

### 6.5.2 Current Position

```
As of 2025:

Level 1: Already over (+1.5°C is almost inevitable)
Level 2: Just before (5 years to go)
Level 3: Still able to afford (15-20 years to go)
↓
That means
↓ Best
future: Lost
good future: Still possible
A catastrophic future: still avoidable
```

```

### 6.6.2 Why 5 years (reaffirmed)

**Physical Reasons:**

```
Time lag of 20-30 years
↓
The state of 2050 will be
determined by actions in 2020-2030

↓
To
avoid +2°C in 2050 ↓
Measures must be started by 2030 at the latest
```

**Technical Reasons:**

```
Large-scale system deployment:
concept → demonstration → mass production → deployment
↓
Normal: 10-20 years required
↓
Even if it is urgently accelerated: 5-10 years
↓
At the beginning of
2030 ↓
Effect
in 2040-2050 ↓
Results
in 2060-2080 considering the time lag ↓
Too late
```

**Tipping Point Reason:**

```
Many tipping points: around +2°C
↓
Current situation: +1.5°C
↓
Current pace: +2°C
in 10-20 years ↓
Acceleration
beyond tipping points ↓
Before
it gets out of control ↓
Measures needed now
```

## 6.7 The Gap between Hope and Despair

### 6.7.1 Reasons for Not Being Optimistic

**Reality:**

```
1. Lack
of political will - Conflict of interests of countries
- Domination
of short-term thinking - Rise of populism

2. Economic resistance
- Vested interests
in the fossil fuel industry - Rejection
of short-term cost burden - Resistance to structural reforms

3. Social inertia
- resistance
to lifestyle change - lack
of sense of crisis - awareness of "someone will do something"

4. Technical Challenges
- Difficulty
in Large-scale Deployment - Lack
of Investment - Delay in Infrastructure Development
```

### 6.7.2 Why You Have Hope

**Possibility:**

```
1. The technology already exists
- Ocean Breathing System: Implementable
- Renewable energy: cost reduction
- Carbon capture: practical stage

2. Change
in perception - Feeling the frequent occurrence of extreme weather
- Awareness of crisis among the younger generation
- Expansion of the global movement

3. Economic rationality
- Cost competitiveness
of renewable energy - Increasing
costs of climate disasters - Growth of the green economy

4. Acceleration
of change - Speed
of technological innovation - Wave
of social change - Existence
of a tipping point (not only for the bad, but also for the good)
```

### 6.7.3 "Structured Hope"

**Instead of Emotional Hope:**

```
"I'm sure it will work out"
↓
This is dangerous optimism

"Someone will do something"
↓
This is irresponsible and left to others
```

**Structural Hope:**

```
"If we implement this system,
we can achieve this effect mathematically and physically
"
↓
Ocean Breathing System
↓
CO2 Absorption: Computable
Dead Zone Elimination: Predictable
Large-scale deployment: Implementable
↓
Reproducible hope

## 7.1 Fundamentals

### 7.1.1 Vertical Circulation in Nature

**The Ocean in Its Original Form:**

```
Surface layer (0-200 m):
- Light reaches (photosynthetically possible)
- Warm
- Low in nutrients (consumed by living organisms)

Deep (depth of more than 200 m):
- No light
reaching - Cold
- Rich in nutrients (accumulated through the decomposition of biological remains)
↓
The "vertical circulation" connects the two
```

**Mechanism of Vertical Circulation:**

```
Cooling
in winter ↓
Increase
in density of surface water ↓
Sedimentation (downstream)
↓
Pushing up of deep water (updraft)
↓
Nutrients to
the surface ↓
Plankton bloom
in spring ↓
photosynthetic explosion
↓
CO2 absorption
↓
foundation of marine ecosystems
```

### 7.1.2 Stopping the Vertical Cycle

**Impact of Global Warming:**

```
Rise
in sea surface temperature ↓
Widening
density difference between surface and deep layers ↓
Strengthening
of stratification ↓
Attenuation and arrest
of vertical circulation ↓
Nutrients do not
reach the surface layer ↓
Plankton decrease
↓
├→ Decrease in CO2 absorption capacity → Acceleration
of global warming└→ Suspension of oxygen supply → Expansion of dead zones
```

**Current Status (2025):**

```
Vertical circulation weakens globally
↓
Dead zones: about 700 locations
Area: about 240,000 km²
↓
Expansion continues
```

### 7.1.3 Ocean Breathing Systemの発想

**Question:**

```
"Can we artificially create vertical circulation without
waiting for winter cooling?"
↓
"Can we transport deep nutrient-rich seawater to
the surface?"
↓
"Can you let the sea breathe?"
```

**Answer: Deep-Sea Aeration**

```
Sending air to the deep sea (250m)
↓
Air bubbles rise
↓
Enveloping the surrounding seawater (air lift effect)
↓
Deep water to the
surface ↓
Supplying
nutrients ↓
Plankton activation
↓
CO2 fixation
↓
restoration of marine respiration

## 7.3 Energy Balance

### 7.3.1 Power Generation

**Total Power Generation Capacity:**

```
Solar: 1.2kW (peak) Wind
power: 0.4kW (rated) Tidal
power: 0.2kW (rated)
↓
Total: 1.8kW (theoretical peak)
```

**Average Power:**

```
太陽光：200W（年平均、稼働率17%）
風力 ：120W（年平均、稼働率30%）
潮力 ：140W（年平均、稼働率70%）
↓
合計 ：460W
```

**Daily Power Generation:**

```
460W × 24h = 11.04 kWh/日
```

### 7.3.2 Consumption

**Breakdown:**

```
Compressor: 5kW × Operating time
control system: 50W × 24h = 1.2 kWh/day
Telecommunications system: 20W × 24h = 0.5 kWh/day
Others: 30W × 24h = 0.7 kWh/day
↓
Basic consumption (non-compressor): 2.4 kWh/day
```

**Compressor Operating Time:**

```
Surplus generation: 11.04 - 2.4 = 8.64 kWh/day
↓
Compressor operating time:
8.64 kWh / 5 kW = 1.73 h/day
↓
Approx. 1.7 hours/day
```

### 7.3.3 Duty Cycle Control

**Issue:**

```
I want to
drive continuously ↓
but 1.7 hours/day is not enough
```

**Solution: Intermittent Operation**

```
Pattern 1: Short time intensive
operation: 30 minutes ON pause
: 30 minutes OFF
↓
Actual operation: 12 hours/day (50% duty)
↓
Consumption: 5kW × 6h = 30 kWh/day
↓
Insufficient: 30 - 11.04 = 18.96 kWh/day
↓
impossible
```

**Pattern 2: Long-Term Dispersion**

```
Operation: 1 hour ON Stop
: 2 hours OFF
↓
Cycle: 3 hours
↓
1 day: 24h / 3h = 8 cycles
↓
Actual operation: 8 hours / day (33% duty)
↓
Consumption: 5kW × 8h = 40 kWh/day
↓
Insufficient: 40 - 11.04 = 28.96 kWh/day
↓
Still insufficient
```

**Pattern 3: Utilization of storage batteries**

```
Sunny weather:
High power generation → Compressor running for a long time → Storage battery charging

Cloudy weather and night:
Low power generation → Battery discharge → Short operation of the compressor

In bad weather:
Extremely small power generation → Compressor shutdown → Storage battery preservation
↓
3-day average balance
```

**Optimal Driving Pattern:**

```
Sunny day:
Compressor: 4 hours of operation (20 kWh consumption)
Power generation: 15 kWh
Basic consumption: 2.4 kWh
↓
Surplus: 15 - 20 - 2.4 = -7.4 kWh
↓
Replenishment from storage battery

Cloudy weather:
Compressor: 2 hours of operation (10 kWh)
Power generation: 8 kWh
Basic consumption: 2.4 kWh
↓
Surplus: 8 - 10 - 2.4 = -4.4 kWh
↓
Replenishment from storage battery

Bad weather days:
Compressor: Stop
power generation: 3 kWh
Basic consumption: 2.4 kWh
↓
Surplus: 3 - 2.4 = +0.6 kWh
↓
Charge
to storage battery ↓
Balanced on weekly average
```

### 7.3.4 Improvement Options

## 14.4 障壁の克服

### 14.4.1 心理的障壁

**「自分には関係ない」**

```
いいえ
↓
気候変動は
↓
すべての人に影響する
↓
あなたも
↓
あなたの子供も
↓
逃げられない
```

**「自分一人では無力だ」**

```
一人では小さい
↓
しかし
↓
無力ではない
↓
あなたの行動が
↓
他者を動かす
↓
波紋が広がる
```

**「もう手遅れだ」**

```
いいえ
↓
まだ間に合う
↓
2025-2030年に行動すれば
↓
2050年に間に合う
↓
諦めるには
↓
まだ早い
```

**「誰かがやってくれる」**

```
その「誰か」とは
↓
あなたのことだ
↓
私たち全員が
↓
「誰か」になる必要がある
```

### 14.4.2 実践的障壁

1,825日
↓
43,800時間
↓
一日一日が
↓
貴重
↓
無駄にできない
```

### 14.5.2 不可逆性

```
ティッピングポイントを越えれば
↓
元に戻せない
↓
グリーンランド氷床が融解開始すれば
↓
数百-数千年止まらない
↓
アマゾンがサバンナ化すれば
↓
元の熱帯雨林には戻らない
↓
だから
↓
越える前に
↓
止めなければならない
```

### 14.5.3 タイムラグの残酷さ

```
今日、排出をゼロにしても
↓
20-30年は温暖化が続く
↓
つまり
↓
2050年の状態は
↓
2020-2030年の行動で決まる
↓
だから
↓
今すぐ行動が必要

- 硝酸塩：表層の10-50倍
- リン酸塩：表層の20-100倍
- ケイ酸塩：表層の50-200倍

保守的仮定：栄養塩上昇により
植物プランクトン量が10倍増加

【影響範囲】
螺旋吹出による拡散：
半径150 m
面積：π × (150)² ≈ 70,000 m² = 0.07 km²
```

#### B.1.2 光合成による炭素固定

```
【一次生産量】
温帯海域の一次生産量：
約100-200 gC/m²/年（表層）

栄養塩制限が解除された場合：
約200-300 gC/m²/年

20 gC/m²/年（栄養塩上昇分のみ）

【年間炭素固定量】
影響面積：70,000 m²
単位面積あたり：20 gC/m²/年
↓
総炭素固定量：
70,000 × 20 = 1,400,000 g = 1,400 kg = 1.4 ton 炭素/年

【CO2換算】
炭素の分子量：12
CO2の分子量：44
換算係数：44/12 ≈ 3.67
↓
CO2固定量：
1.4 × 3.67 ≈ 5.1 ton CO2/年
↓
約5 ton CO2/年/基（保守的）
```

#### B.1.3 不確実性

```
【上振れ要因】
- プランクトン増加率が10倍以上
- 影響範囲が予測より広い
- 食物連鎖による追加固定
↓
実際は5-10 ton CO2/年の可能性

【下振れ要因】
- プランクトン増加率が10倍未満
- 他の制限要因（光、温度等）
- 季節変動
↓
最悪ケース：2-3 ton CO2/年

【採用値】
保守的中央値：5 ton CO2/年/基
```

### B.2 エネルギー収支の計算

## Appendix E: FAQs (Frequently Asked Questions)

### E.1 Technical Questions

Q1: Does the Ocean Breathing System really work? **

```
A: The basic principle (airlift, vertical circulation) is a proven physical phenomenon.
All individual elemental technologies (solar power generation, compressors, etc.) are also put into practical use.
The new ones are the "combination method" and the "spiral blowing outlet",
which are also based on the principle of fluid dynamics and are highly feasible.
However, the actual effect must be confirmed in a demonstration test.
```

**Q2: Will it be damaged by a typhoon? **

```
A: Typhoon resistance is considered in the structural design (maximum wind speed of 60 m/s is assumed).
Also, the shape of the regular octahedron is structurally stable.
However, there is a risk of loss in the case of a typhoon that exceeds expectations.
Therefore, it is covered by insurance and the design is continuously improved.
With distributed arrangements, even if some are lost, the impact on the whole is limited.
```

**Q3: 生物付着で機能しなくなりませんか？**

```
A: Biofouling is unavoidable in marine structures.
As a countermeasure, anti-fouling paint is applied and regular cleaning (once a year) is performed.
We are considering allowing a certain amount of adhesion and actively evaluating it as a reef effect.
```

**Q4: Is it really enough energy? **

```
A: Conservative calculations are slightly insufficient,
but they can be handled by duty cycle control (intermittent operation) and the use of storage batteries.
In addition, if you double the solar panels (12 m²), you can drive with plenty of room.
Optimize your energy budget with demonstration tests.
```

**Q5: Is the effectiveness of the spiral blow port proven? **

```
A: It is based on the principles of fluid dynamics (Bernoulli effect, Coanda effect), but
the specific mixing efficiency improvement (10x) is model calculation and analogy.
Validation tests confirm effectiveness and optimize geometry as needed.
```

### E.2 Environmental Impact Questions

**Q6: Will there be red tides? **

```
A: The nutrient supply is local (about 150 m radius) and
mimics natural upwelling currents.
Phased deployment and continuous monitoring ensure
immediate response to any signs of red tide occurrence.
In the past, productivity was high in the upwelling zone (natural nutrient supply area),
and red tides were rare.
```

Q7: Will it disturb the ecosystem? **

```
A: It assists in natural vertical circulation and
is basically a restoration to its original state.
However, due to the potential for unintended impacts,
thorough environmental impact assessments and continuous monitoring are conducted.
If a problem occurs, stop operation and take countermeasures.
```

**Q8: What is the impact on deep-sea life? **

```
A: The effects of air aeration are considered limited,
but we will also investigate deep-sea organisms in demonstration tests.
The 250m depth is "medium deep", and although it is not
as specific as the deep sea (usually referring to depths above 1000m), it is carefully evaluated.
```

### E.3 経済性に関する質問

**Q9: 本当に経済的に成立しますか？**

```
A: 投資回収期間は約35年（複数の便益を含む）で、
耐用年数（30-40年）ギリギリです。
カーボンクレジット価格が上昇すれば、より早く回収できます。
また、気候変動対策の「保険」と考えれば、
便益は金銭では測れない価値（人類の存続）があります。
```

**Q10: 誰が費用を負担するのですか？**

```
A: We envision a variety of funding sources:
- Government budget (environmental measures)
- Private investment (green bonds, ESG investment)
- International organizations (climate fund)
- Carbon credit income
Initially, public funds will be the main source, but we expect private funds to be the main source after the effect is demonstrated.
```

**Q11: Can it be introduced in developing countries? **

```
A: It is possible with technology transfer and financial support.
The blueprints are open source,
so they can be manufactured in each country.
Funding will be funded by international climate funds and aid from developed countries.
```

### E.4 Implementation Questions

Q12: When can I start? **

```
A: Preparations can begin immediately after the publication of this paper (November 2025).
Once the funds and structure are in place, prototype production can begin in Q2 2025.
The first unit is planned to be installed in Q4 2025 and demonstration tests will begin.
```

Q13: Can individuals participate? **

```
A: Yes, you can participate in various ways:
- Sharing information (spreading the word on social media, etc.)
- Funding (crowdfunding, etc.)
- Community practice (roofing, composting, etc.)
- Providing expertise (for researchers and engineers)
- Volunteering (events, awareness activities, etc.)
Everyone has a role.
```

Q14: How can I engage with governments and businesses? **

```
A: There are the following methods:
- Submission
of requests to members of parliament and the government- Email
and SNS lobbying to companies- Proposals
at general meetings of shareholders as shareholders - Signature activities and petitions
- Posting
to the media - Expressing
intention by voting Speaking up is the first step.
```

### E.5 Skeptical Questions

Q15: Isn't it a new "dream story"? **

```
A: 本論文は以下の点で他の提案と異なります：
1. 既存技術のみを使用（実証済み）
2. 詳細な設計仕様を提示
3. 経済性を計算・提示
4. リスクを明示
5. 実装ロードマップを具体化
6. オープンソースで公開（検証可能）
夢ではなく、実装可能な計画です。
```

**Q16: なぜ今まで誰もやらなかったのですか？**

```
A: いくつかの理由があります：
1. 深海エアレーションの概念自体は存在したが、
エネルギー自給型の設計が難しかった
2. 経済性の評価が不十分だった
3. 気候危機の緊急性が十分認識されていなかった
4. 統合的視点（海洋+都市）が欠けていた​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​​
```

### E.5 懐疑的な質問（続き）

**Q16: なぜ今まで誰もやらなかったのですか？（続き）**

```
技術は揃っていましたが、それを統合し、
経済性を含めて包括的に設計する試みが不足していました。
また、オープンソース化という発想も新しいアプローチです。
今こそ、緊急性と技術の成熟が一致した時です。
```

**Q17: IPCCの科学者たちが見落としているはずがないのでは？**

```
A: IPCCは優れた仕事をしていますが、以下の特性があります：
1. 科学的確実性を重視（保守的）
2. 政策的影響を考慮（慎重）
3. 既存研究のレビューが中心（新提案は限定的）

本論文は：
- 技術的実装提案（IPCCの範囲外）
- 非線形シナリオを強調（IPCCも認識しているが控えめ）
- 統合的アプローチ（学際的）

IPCCを否定するのではなく、補完する位置づけです。
```

**Q18: こんな簡単なことで気候危機が解決できるなら、苦労しませんよね？**

```
A: 「簡単」ではありません。
技術的には実現可能ですが、実装には：
- 莫大な資金（$4.5 trillion）
- 25年の継続的努力
- 国際協力
- 社会的合意
- 政治的決断
が必要です。

技術的解決策は存在しますが、
社会的・政治的実装が最大の課題です。
しかし、不可能ではありません。
人類は過去にも大きな挑戦を乗り越えてきました。
```

**Q19: 失敗したらどうするのですか？**

```
A: We are aware of the risks (see Chapter 12).
But doing
nothing is much more dangerous than the risk of failure.

Even if you fail:
- You get
data and lessons learned- You can
use them for your next attempt - Even partial success is worth it

If we do nothing:
- The climate crisis will surely progress
- We will have no options

Smart risk-taking is what is needed now.
```

### E.6 Philosophical Questions

Q20: Isn't it a problem for humans to intervene in nature? **

```
A: Humans have already intervened in nature on a large scale (fossil fuel burning, deforestation, etc.).
The problem is the "quality of the intervention".

Destructive intervention: Ignoring the laws of nature, one-way, unsustainable
This proposal: following the laws of nature, circular, sustainable

It is impossible to reduce the intervention in nature to zero (population 8 billion).
If so, we should intervene wisely.

The Ocean Breathing System is an attempt to restore the balance of nature that
has been broken by humans with
the assistance of human technology.
```

Q21: Isn't it a technology supremacy? Isn't lifestyle change important? **

```
A: You need both, not one or the other.

This paper also includes:
- Urban environment improvement: including
lifestyle change - Recycling-oriented society: Transformation
of consumer behavior - Community regeneration: Transformation of social relations

Technology is a means, not an end.
The aim is "sustainable civilization",
which requires both technology and lifestyle transformation.

Technology alone is not enough, but
lifestyle change alone is not enough.
An integrated approach is key.
```

**Q22: 人類は滅びるべきではないですか？地球のために。**

```
A: この視点には二つの問題があります：

1. 人間も自然の一部です。
人間だけが「悪」ではありません。

2. 人間が消えても、気候変動の影響は残ります。
既に放出されたCO2は数百年残り、
他の生物にも影響を与え続けます。

むしろ：
人間の知性と技術を、
破壊ではなく回復に使うべきです。

人類が持続可能な文明を築けるなら、
それは地球全体の生態系にとっても
プラスになります。

諦めるのではなく、
責任を果たすべきです。
```

### E.7 実践的な質問

組織体制が整っていないため、
直接的な寄付・投資の受付体制はありません。

しかし：
- 情報を広めること
- 地域での実践
- 関連企業・団体への働きかけ
- 政府への要望

これらも重要な「投資」です。

資金調達体制が整い次第、
GitHubやNOTEで告知します。
```

4. 実現可能な計画を立てる（小規模から）
5. 行政・企業に働きかける
6. パイロットプロジェクトを開始

NOTEやGitHubで事例共有のプラットフォームを
構築予定です。
```

### E.8 時間に関する質問

**Q28: 本当にあと5年しかないのですか？2030年以降では絶対に手遅れですか？**

```
A: 「絶対に」手遅れというわけではありませんが、
極めて困難になります。

理由：
- タイムラグ（20-30年）
- ティッピングポイントの閾値（+2℃前後）
- 現在の温暖化ペース

2030年開始の場合：
効果が出るのは2050-2060年
↓
その時点で既に+2.5℃以上の可能性
↓
多くのティッピングポイント越え
↓
制御困難

したがって、2025-2030年が
「最後のチャンス」です。

ただし、2030年以降でも
諦めるべきではありません。
遅くても、やらないよりは遥かにマシです。
```

**Q29: 25年は長すぎませんか？もっと早くできませんか？**

```
A: 25年は以下の理由で必要です：

1. 製造には時間がかかる
- 100,000基のOcean Breathing System
- 世界中の都市改造

2. 社会的合意形成に時間がかかる

3. 段階的展開が安全（環境影響確認）

4. タイムラグ（効果が出るまで20-30年）

もちろん、加速できればベストです。
資金・人材・社会的合意が十分なら、
15-20年に短縮できる可能性もあります。

しかし、急ぎすぎて失敗するリスクもあります。
バランスが重要です。
```

**Q30: 2050年までに間に合わなかったら？**

```
A: その場合でも、諦めてはいけません。

2060年、2070年でも：
- 温暖化をそれ以上悪化させない
- 部分的な回復
- 次の世代への基盤

は可能です。

最悪シナリオ（+7-8℃）と
次善シナリオ（+3-4℃）では、
人類文明への影響が全く異なります。

どの時点でも、
行動する価値はあります。

ただし、早ければ早いほど良いのは確実です。

#Part II: Ideological Foundations

## -Recognition of natural and sustainable laws-

-----

# Chapter 1: The Four Principles of Human Survival

-----

1.1 Overview of the Four Principles

In order for humanity to build a sustainable civilization, it is necessary to understand and practice basic principles based on natural and sustainable laws.

This chapter defines the four principles of human survival and clarifies their significance.

-----

### Definition of the Four Principles

1.
Law of Nature / Providence
2. Harmony
3. Circulation / Cycle 4.
Structure

These four principles are not independent, but rather form an integrated system that is interrelated and supports each other.

-----

1.2 First Principle: Law of Nature / Providence

### Definition

**Providence is the fundamental structure and laws of the universe and nature.**

It exists independently of human will or desire and is a universal law that governs all phenomena.

### Basic concepts

#### The immutability of providence

Providence has the following characteristics:

- **Universality**: Applies across time and space
- **Immutability**: Cannot be artificially altered
- **Necessity**: Works without exception
- **Objectivity**: Does not depend on the observer

#### Examples of Providence

Physical Providence:

- Law of gravity
- Law of thermodynamics (increase in entropy)
- Law of conservation of energy

Biological Providence:

- The birth, growth, and death of life
- The evolution of species
- Ecological balance

Earth Science Providence:

- Water cycle
- Atmospheric cycle
- Crustal movements

### Human civilization and providence

#### Adaptation to Providence vs. Rebellion against Providence

**Examples of applications:**

- Agriculture: Follow the cycle of the seasons
- Architecture: Respond to gravity and climate
- Medicine: Support the body's natural healing powers

**Examples of rebellion:**

- Mass consumption of fossil fuels: Destruction of the carbon cycle
- Mass production and mass waste: Ignorance of material cycles
- Destruction of ecosystems: Disregard for biodiversity

#### The result of ignoring providence

Lessons from history:

1. **Collapse of Civilization**

- Mesopotamia: Devastation of farmland due to salt damage
- Easter Island: Ecosystem collapse due to deforestation
- Mayan civilization: Depletion of water resources

1. **Modern Crisis**

- Climate change: destruction of the carbon cycle
- Marine pollution: disregard for material cycles
- Loss of biodiversity: destruction of ecosystems

### Recognition of providence

**For humanity to survive:**

1. **Humility**: Abandon the arrogance of believing you can control nature.
1. **Observation**: Deeply understand the laws of nature.
1. **Adaptation**: Build technological and social systems that are in line with nature's laws
. 1. **Respect**: Respect nature and coexist with it.

-----

## 1.3 Second principle: Harmony

### Definition

**Harmony is maintaining a balance between nature, society, and individuals.**

It means coexistence rather than conflict, cooperation rather than domination, and distribution rather than monopoly.

### Three-layered structure of harmony

#### 1. Harmony with nature

**Coexistence between humans and the natural environment**

- Sustainable use of resources
- Preservation of ecosystems
- Climate stabilization
- Maintenance of biodiversity

**Examples of lost harmony:**

- Heat island phenomenon: the incongruity between cities and nature
- Marine dead zones: the incongruity between human activities and the ocean
- Increase in forest fires: the incongruity between climate change and forests

#### 2. Harmony with society

**Human coexistence**

- Respect for cultural diversity
- Reducing economic disparities
- Promoting international cooperation
- Intergenerational equity

**Current state of disharmony:**

- Widening gap between rich and poor
- Conflict over resources
- Cultural and religious clashes
- Debt to future generations (environmental destruction, fiscal deficits)

#### 3. Harmony with the individual

**Harmony with Self**

- Physical and mental health
- Mental stability
- Purpose in life
- Inner peace

Symptoms of disharmony:

- Stressful society
- Increase in mental illness
- Death from overwork and suicide
- Loss of meaning in life

### How to achieve harmony

#### Principle

1. **Dialogue**: Deepening mutual understanding
1. **Compromise**: Aiming for overall optimization
1. **Empathy**: Understanding other people's perspectives
1. **Tolerance**: Accepting differences

#### Practice

- **Respect for diversity**: Recognizing different values
​​- **Coexistence and co-prosperity**: Building win-win relationships
- **Altruism**: Considering the interests of others as one's own
- **Fairness**: Fair distribution of resources and opportunities

-----

## 1.4 Third principle: Circulation / Cycle

### Definition

**Circulation is the continuous flow of resources, energy, and life.**

It means a cycle rather than a one-way street, metabolism rather than consumption, and regeneration rather than disposal.

### Cycles of nature

#### 1. Water Cycle

Evaporation
→ Clouds → Rainfall → Rivers → Oceans →
Evaporation

- Powered by solar energy
- Global circulation
- Source of freshwater

**Man-made destruction:**

- Blockage of flow by dams
- Overextraction of groundwater
- Water pollution

#### 2. Carbon Cycle

Atmospheric
CO2 → Photosynthesis → Organic matter → Respiration/Decomposition →
CO2

- Approximately 10 billion tons/year of natural circulation
- Oceans and forests are sinks

**Man-made destruction:**

- Fossil fuel burning: Approximately 40 billion tons of CO2 emitted annually
- Deforestation: Loss of carbon sink
- Ocean acidification: Decrease in absorption capacity

#### 3. Nutrient cycling

Surface
→ Biological production → Death and sinking → Deep layer → Upwelling →
Surface

- Supporting ocean productivity
- Vertical circulation is key

**Man-made destruction:**

- Stratification due to global warming
- Cessation of vertical circulation
- Expansion of dead zones

### The cycle of human society

#### Circular systems in traditional societies

**Japan in the Edo Period:**

- Excrement → Fertilizer → Crops → Food → Excrement
- Clothing: Kimono → Rags → Cloths → Fuel
- Construction: Wood → Construction → Demolition → Reuse

**result:**

- Nearly 100% resource recycling
- Maintaining a sustainable society for 300 years

Modern Linear Systems

Resource
extraction → production → consumption →
disposal

**Problem:**

- Resource depletion
- Waste accumulation
- Environmental pollution
- Unsustainable

### Rebuilding circulation

#### The circular economy we should strive for

**principle:**

1. **Reduce**: Reduce waste
1. **Reuse**: Use repeatedly
1. **Recycle**: Return to resources
1. **Regenerate**: Recover using the power of nature

**Example:**

- Organic waste → Compost → Agriculture
- Waste plastic → Recycled plastic
- Sewage → Purification → Recycled water
- CO2 → Algae cultivation → Biofuel

-----

## 1.5 Fourth Principle: Structure

### Definition

**Structure is the design of stable social, technological and natural infrastructure.**

It means design rather than chance, reason rather than emotion, and the long term rather than the short term.

### The importance of structure

#### Why structure?

**Hope is not a feeling, it's a structure.**

- Emotion: temporary, unstable
- Structure: lasting, stable

**example:**

- "If we try hard enough, we can make it work" (emotion)
- vs
- "This system will last" (structure)

### Structural Design Principles

#### 1. Long-term perspective

**Short-term optimal vs. long-term optimal**

Examples of short-term optimization:

- Fossil fuels: convenient now, but a liability in the future
- Mass production: cheap now, but waste accumulation

Long-term optimal example:

- Renewable energy: Large initial investment, but sustainable
- Circular system: Complex design, but stable over the long term

#### 2. Systems Thinking

**Partial optimization vs. global optimization**

Suboptimal problem:

- Narrowing of perspective due to specialization
- Optimization of subsystems leads to deoptimization of the whole

The need for holistic optimization:

- Integrated perspective
- Understanding interactions
- Designing feedback loops

#### 3. Redundancy and Robustness

**Efficiency vs. Robustness**

Efficiency-focused vulnerabilities:

- Just-in-time production: Fails in the event of a disaster
- Dependence on a single power source: Paralyzed in the event of a power outage

Robust design:

- Redundancy: backup system
- Diversity: multiple options
- Diversification: risk distribution

#### 4. Adaptability

**Fixed vs Flexible**

Persistent system issues:

- Unable to adapt to environmental changes
- Unexpectedly fragile

Benefits of adaptive systems:

- Adaptable to change
- Learn and evolve
- Deal with unexpected situations

### Specific examples of structure

Ocean Breathing System

**Structural Features:**

1. **Long-term perspective**

- Centennial climate stabilization

1. **Systems Thinking**

- Considering the entire ocean circulation
- Integrating energy, nutrients, and CO2

1. **Redundancy**

- Combined solar, wind and tidal power generation
- Even if one unit breaks down, the whole system will continue to function

1. **Adaptability**

- Modular design
- Incremental expansion possible
- Room for improvement

**result:**

- Sustainable Climate Stabilization Systems
- Reproducible Structures of Hope

-----

## 1.6 Integration of the Four Principles

### Interrelationships

The four principles are not independent but mutually supportive:

Providence
: Foundation (Laws of Nature)
↓
Harmony: Relationships (Balance)
↓
Circulation: Dynamics (Flow)
↓
Structure: Design (Sustainability)
↓
Return to
Providence```

### Integration in Practice

**Implemented in Ocean Breathing System:**

1. **Providence**: Understand and mimic the natural circulation of the ocean
. 1. **Harmony**: Harmony between artificial and natural, symbiosis between technology and ecosystems
. 1. **Circulation**: Restoring the circulation of nutrients, CO2, and energy
. 1. **Structure**: Long-term stable design, reproducible hope.

-----

## 1.7 Summary

The four principles of human survival are:

1. **Providence**: Understanding and following the laws of nature
1. **Harmony**: Maintaining balance between nature, society, and oneself
1. **Circulation**: Circulating resources and energy
1. **Structure**: Designing systems that are stable over the long term

By putting these into practice, a sustainable civilization will be realized.

# Chapter 2: Subsidiary Principles and Practices

-----

2.1 Position of the Subsidiarity Principle

The four principles (providence, harmony, circulation, and structure) are the foundation for human survival, but more specific guidelines are needed to put them into practice.

The subsidiary principles presented in this chapter are intended to make the principle of harmony concrete and put it into everyday practice.

-----

### Five Pillars of Subsidiarity

1.
Understanding Nature
2. Coexistence & Co-prosperity 3.
Altruistic Symbiosis
4. Diversity
5. Tolerance

These are not independent principles, but are organically linked under the broad umbrella of "harmony."

-----

2.2 First Subsidiary Principle: Understanding Nature

### Definition

**Understanding nature means deeply learning about and recognizing the mechanisms, laws, and providence of nature.**

This is a prerequisite for practicing providence.

### Why understanding is necessary

The destruction caused by ignorance

**Historical Examples**

1. The Tragedy of DDT

- 1940s-60s: Used as a revolutionary insecticide
- Lack of understanding: No concept of bioaccumulation
- Result: Mass bird deaths, destruction of ecosystems
- Lesson learned: The danger of partial understanding

1. **Lessons from CFCs**

- 1930s-1980s: Popularized as an ideal refrigerant
- Lack of understanding: Unable to predict its impact on the ozone layer
- Result: Ozone hole formation
- Lesson learned: Importance of predicting long-term impacts

1. **Fossil Fuel Blind Spot**

- Post-industrial revolution: Energy revolution
- Lack of understanding: Impact on carbon cycle
- Consequences: Climate change
- Lessons learned: Need for a global perspective

### Deepening your understanding

Level 1: Superficial understanding

**"Knowing" level**

- Memorization of facts
- Superficial causal relationships
- Single perspective

**example:**

- "Increasing CO2 levels will cause global warming"
- "Deforestation will be a problem"

#### Level 2: Understanding the Mechanism

**"I understand" level**

- Understanding the mechanisms
- Multiple causal relationships
- Systems perspective

**example:**

- "CO2 absorbs infrared rays and traps heat"
- "Forests absorb CO2 through photosynthesis and release oxygen"

Level 3: Integrated Understanding

**"Visible" level**

- See the big picture
- Understand interactions
- Predict long-term impacts

**example:**

- "Fossil fuel burning → Increased CO2 → Global warming → Rising sea surface temperature → Cessation of vertical circulation → Decrease in plankton → Decrease in CO2 absorption → Accelerated global warming"
- "Deforestation → Decrease in CO2 absorption + Soil erosion → River pollution → Marine eutrophication → Red tide → Decrease in fish population → Collapse of the food chain"

### Understanding in Practice

#### observation

**Observing Nature Directly**

- Feel the change of seasons
- See the activities of living things
- Become aware of climate change

**effect:**

- Gaining intuitive understanding
- Sharpening sensitivity
- Respect for nature

#### study

**Learn scientific knowledge**

- Ecology
- Climatology

- Combining experience and knowledge
- Intuition and logic
- Understanding the big picture

**effect:**

- Gaining deep understanding
- Making wise decisions
- Taking sustainable actions

-----

## 2.3 Second Subsidiary Principle: Coexistence and Co-prosperity

### Definition

**Coexistence and co-prosperity means living and prospering together with nature and others.**

This means building win-win relationships, rather than a zero-sum game (someone's win is someone else's loss).

### Conventional thinking patterns

#### Domination/conquest type

**Paradigm of Western Modern Civilization**

Humans
> Nature >
Weak >
Developed > Developing

**result:**

- Environmental destruction
- Growing inequality
- Intensifying conflict
- Unsustainable

#### Competition and selection type

**The logic of capitalism**

Competition
→ Selection of winners and losers
→ Efficiency
growth → Infinite
expansion

**Problem:**

- Infinite growth is impossible on a finite planet
- Cutting off losers
- Ignoring environmental costs

### New thinking patterns

#### Symbiotic/cooperative type

**The Paradigm of Sustainable Civilization**

Humans
⇄ Nature (Interdependence)
Strong ⇄ Weak (Mutual Support) Developed
Countries ⇄ Developing Countries (Mutual Cooperation)

**result:**

- Environmental conservation
- Reducing disparities
- Promoting cooperation
- Sustainable

### Practicing coexistence and co-prosperity

#### 1. Coexistence and prosperity with nature

**Traditional Agricultural Wisdom**

- Crop rotation: Allows the soil to rest
- Mixed cropping: Reduces pests and diseases
- Compost: Creates a cycle

**Integration with modern technology**

- Agroforestry: The fusion of forests and agriculture
- Permaculture: Sustainable agriculture
- Natural farming: Harnessing the power of nature

**Ocean Breathing System Example**

- Mimicking natural vertical circulation
- Collaboration between artificial and natural
- Coexistence with the marine ecosystem
- Result: Both thrive

#### 2. Coexistence and prosperity among humans

**International Cooperation**

Conventional:

- Competition for resources
- Zero-sum game
- Conflict and war

New shape:

- Sharing of technology (open source)
- Sharing of knowledge (educational support)
- Fair distribution of resources
- Result: Overall improvement

**Economic System**

Conventional:

- Unilateral exploitation
- Concentration of wealth
- Widening inequality

New shape:

- Fair Trade
- Social Enterprise
- Basic Income
- Outcome: Sustainable Prosperity

#### 3. Coexistence and prosperity between generations

**Responsibility of the current generation**

- Not leaving debt to the next generation
- Preserving the environment
- Building a sustainable system

**Rights of Future Generations**

- Clean air and water
- Stable climate
- Abundant nature
- Freedom of choice

-----

## 2.4 Third auxiliary principle: Altruism

### Definition

**Altruism is the idea that the interests of others are one's own interests.**

This means going beyond selfishness and building relationships in which altruism ultimately leads to self-interest.

### The limits of selfishness

#### Short-term selfishness

**"As long as I'm happy, that's all that matters."**

- Profiting even at the expense of the environment
- Growing at the expense of others
- Enjoying the present without regard for the future

**result:**

- Tragedy of the Commons
- Prisoner's Dilemma
- Total collapse

#### Long-term selfishness

**"For my future self"**

- Preserve the environment (secure future resources)
- Cooperate with others (secure future cooperation)
- Pursue sustainability (secure future stability)

**Problem:**

- Still selfish
- Only within the limits of what is calculable
- Unexpectedly vulnerable

### The idea of ​​mutual benefit

#### Basic concepts

**"The happiness of others is your happiness"**

this is:

- Values, not calculations
- Gifts, not exchanges
- Unconditional, not conditions

#### Symbiosis in nature

**Examples of symbiosis**

1. **Rhizobium and plants**

- Rhizobium: Provides nitrogen fixation
- Plant: Provides sugars
- Result: Both survive and thrive

1. **Gut bacteria and humans**

- Bacteria: aids digestion
- Humans: provide shelter and nutrients
- Result: healthy symbiosis

1. **Corals and Zooxanthellae**

- Zooxanthellae: provide nutrients through photosynthesis
- Corals: provide protection and inorganic nutrients
- Result: thriving coral reefs

**Common points:**

- Win-win relationships
- Interdependence
- Prosperity for all

### Practicing mutual benefit

#### Individual level

**Daily Practice**

- Volunteer activities
- Sharing knowledge for free
- Supporting people in need
- Environmental conservation activities

**Mindset**

- No expectation of return
- Feeling joy
- Feeling connected

#### Social level

**System design**

- Universal healthcare: the health of all is the common good
- Public education: education for all is social development
- Social security: protection of the most vulnerable is social stability

**Corporate activities**

Conventional:

- Maximizing shareholder returns
- Pursuing short-term profits

New shape:

- Stakeholder Focus
- Social Value Creation
- Environmental Conservation
- B Corporation (Public Interest Company)

#### International level

**Opening up the technology**

- Open source software
- Pharmaceutical patent waivers (COVID-19 vaccine)
- Sharing renewable energy technology

**Example of this declaration: Ocean Breathing System**

- Patent waiver
- Free disclosure of knowledge
- Encouragement of sharing improvements
- Result: benefit to all humanity

-----

2.5 Fourth Subsidiary Principle: Diversity

### Definition

**Diversity means recognizing and respecting different existences, values, and cultures.**

It means variety rather than uniformity, plurality rather than unity, and heterogeneity rather than homogeneity.

### The importance of diversity

#### Biological diversity

**Ecosystem Stability**

```A
highly diverse ecosystem:
- The whole can survive even if some species become extinct
- It is easier to adapt to environmental changes
- It prevents the spread of disease

Low diversity ecosystems:
- The extinction of some species can cause the whole to collapse
- Vulnerable to environmental changes - Easily
susceptible to disease outbreaks

**Historical Lessons:**

- Irish Potato Famine (1845-1849)
- Dependence on a single variety
- Complete destruction by disease
- Over 1 million people starved to death

Cultural diversity

**Humanity Richness**

Different cultures are:

- Have different wisdom
- Have different solutions
- Have different beauty

**example:**

- Indigenous people's wisdom on coexistence with nature
- Climate adaptation techniques in each region
- Diverse art, music, and literature

Technological diversity

**The source of innovation**

Single approach:

- When things get stuck, there's no way out
- Concentration of risk

Diverse approaches:

- Multiple solutions
- Risk diversification
- Mutual learning and evolution

-----

2.6 Fifth Subsidiary Principle: Tolerance

### Definition

**Tolerance is the tolerance and acceptance of those who are different from oneself.**

It means inclusion rather than exclusion, understanding rather than attack, and coexistence rather than domination.

### The consequences of intolerance

Historical tragedy

1. **Religious Wars**

- Intolerance of different faiths
- Hundreds of years of massacres

1. **Racism**

- Skin color intolerance
- slavery, genocide, discrimination

1. **Ideological oppression**

- Intolerance of different opinions
- Censorship, purges

Modern Intolerance

- Hate speech
- Xenophobia
- Fundamentalism
- Sectarian conflict

**result:**

- Social division
- Intensification of conflict
- Cycle of violence
- Inability to solve problems

### Practicing tolerance

#### Individual level

**Responding to different opinions**

Intolerance:

- Deciding that something is "wrong"
- Refusing to discuss it
- Attacking it

tolerance:

- Acknowledge that there are other ways of looking at things
- Attempt dialogue
- Try to understand

#### Social level

**System design**

- Guaranteeing freedom of speech
- Protecting the rights of minorities
- Respecting diversity
- Creating a space for dialogue

Setting limits

**The Paradox of Tolerance**

Tolerance of intolerance is:

- Allowing intolerance to flourish
- Destroying a tolerant society

**Karl Popper's teachings:**

"To maintain a tolerant society, we must be intolerant of intolerance"

**Practice:**

- We respect diversity, but
- We do not tolerate violence
, - We do not tolerate discrimination
, - We demand dialogue in the face of refusals to dialogue.

## 2.7 Integration of Subsidiarity Principles

### Relationships among the five principles


Understanding nature (
foundation)
Coexistence and mutual benefit ←→ Mutuality
↓
Diversity ←→ Tolerance
↓
Achieving
harmony

### Cycle of Practice

1. **Understanding** → Gaining a deeper understanding of nature and others
1. **Coexistence** → Building win-win relationships
1. **Altruism** → Wishing the happiness of others
1. **Diversity** → Recognizing differences
1. **Tolerance** → Accepting differences
1. **Harmony** → Achieving balance
1. **Understanding** → Leading to even deeper understanding (a cycle)

-----

## 2.8 Implementation in Ocean Breathing System

### Substantiation of the Subsidiarity Principle

#### Understanding nature

- Understanding the vertical circulation mechanism of the ocean
- Understanding the relationship between nutrients and photosynthesis
- Understanding the global carbon cycle

#### Coexistence and co-prosperity

- Artificial devices and natural oceans function together
- Collaboration between technology and ecosystems
- Coexistence of humans and marine life

#### Altruism

- Opening up technology (waiving patents)
- Sharing knowledge free of charge
- Prioritizing the benefit of all humanity

Diversity

- Combined use of solar, wind and tidal power
- Modular design (diverse deployment)
- Room for improvement (diverse evolution)

#### Tolerance

- Design that tolerates failure (trial and error)
- Open to criticism
- Welcome suggestions for improvement

-----

## 2.9 Summary

The five pillars of the subsidiarity principle are:

1. **Understanding nature**: Learning the laws of nature
1. **Coexistence and co-prosperity**: Prospering together
1. **Altruism**: Wishing the happiness of others
1. **Diversity**: Recognizing differences 1.
**Tolerance**: Accepting differences

These are concrete examples of "harmony" in practice and everyday guidelines for building a sustainable civilization.

#Chapter 3: Analysis of the problems of current civilization

-----

## 3.1 Understanding the current state of civilization

Humanity is currently building the most technologically advanced civilization in history.

But at the same time, we are facing the greatest environmental crisis in history.

This chapter analyzes how modern civilization has deviated from the four principles and identifies the root causes.

-----

## 3.2 Deviation from Providence

### 3.2.1 The idea of ​​dominating nature

The merits and demerits of modern science

**Achievements:**

- Understanding of natural phenomena
- Breakthrough in technology
- Improved standard of living
- Longer life expectancy

**Crime:**

- Arrogance that "we can control nature"
- Establishment of "anthropocentrism"
- Loss of respect for nature

**Francis Bacon (1620):**

"Knowledge is power. Conquer nature."

This idea became the foundation of modern civilization, but it was also the ideological root cause of environmental destruction.

### 3.2.2 Defying the Second Law of Thermodynamics

#### Law of increasing entropy

**The Laws of Nature:**

Order
→ Disorder (increased entropy)
Concentration → Diffusion
Available energy → Heat (unusable
)

This is a fundamental law of the universe and cannot be defied.

#### The illusion of human civilization

**The illusion of "infinite growth"**

Economic assumptions:

- GDP growth rate: 2-3% per year
- Compound interest calculation: exponential growth
- Assumptions: infinite resources, infinite environment

**reality:**

- The Earth is finite
- Resources are finite
- Environmental capacity is finite

**Mathematical necessity:**


Exponential growth is impossible in a finite system. It always
reaches
a limit
.
It collapses or reaches a steady state
.

### 3.2.3 Disruption of the carbon cycle

#### Natural carbon cycle

**Stability over the past million years:**

Atmospheric
CO2: 180-280 ppm
Fluctuation Range: 100 ppm
Period: 100,000 years (glacial cycle)
Temperature Change: Approximately 6°
C

Amidst these gradual changes, humanity evolved and built civilization.

Man-made destruction (since the Industrial Revolution)

**Current situation (2025):**

Atmospheric
CO2: 425-430 ppm
Increase: 150 ppm (in just 250 years)
Rate of increase: more than 100 times
Projected temperature rise: 2-4°C (already 1.5°C rise
)

**The essence of the problem:**

Natural carbon cycle:

Photosynthesis (absorption) ⇄
Respiration/decomposition (emission)
↓
Balanced (±0)

Man-made destruction:

Fossil
fuel burning: 40 billion tons of CO2 released annually
Deforestation: Loss of carbon sink
↓
Net increase of approximately 20 billion tons per year
↓ It is only
a matter of time before the cumulative CO2 emissions exceed 450 ppm

### 3.2.4 Disruption of the water cycle

Groundwater depletion

**Major aquifers of the world:**

- Ogallala Aquifer in the US: 30-50% decrease in the past 50 years
- North China Plain: Water level decline of 1-3m per year
- Ganges Basin in India: Salinization due to excessive pumping

**problem:**

- Recharge rate << pumping rate
- Water accumulated over thousands of years is depleted in a few decades
- Irreversible land subsidence

#### River flow interruption

**Dams of the World:**

- Total number: Over 50,000
- Large dams: Approximately 5,000
- Impact: Approximately 60% of rivers are cut off

**Ecosystem Impacts**

- Extinction of migratory fish
- Sedimentation (downstream coastal erosion)
- Shrinkage of river deltas
- Stopping of nutrient supply to the ocean

-----

## 3.3 Deviations from harmony

### 3.3.1 Disharmony with Nature

Heat island effect

**Urban heat balance destruction:**

Traditional (natural state):


Solar energy ↓
Absorption
by the earth's surface
↓
Evaporation and cooling by plant transpiration
↓
Heat
circulation

Present (urbanization):


Solar energy is absorbed
by
asphalt and concrete
, and
heat is stored (no cooling by evaporation). Heat is radiated even at night
, making urban areas 5-10°C hotter than the surrounding area .




**result:**

- Increased demand for air conditioners → Increased electricity consumption → Increased CO2 emissions
- Increased incidence
of heat stroke - Frequent occurrence of sudden heavy rains
- Changes in ecosystems

Expanding marine dead zones

**mechanism:**

1.
Global warming
↓
2. Rising sea surface temperatures
↓
3. Stratification (strengthening separation between the surface and deep layers)
↓
4. Cessation of vertical circulation
↓
5. Nutrients from the deep layers do not reach the surface layer
↓
6. Decrease in plankton in the surface layer
↓
7. Decrease in CO2 absorption capacity
↓
8. Further warming (vicious cycle)
```

at the same time:


5. Oxygen supply to the deep ocean stops .
6.
Oxygen is lost in the deep ocean
.
7. Organisms die off
.
Dead zones form .

**current situation:**

- Marine dead zones worldwide: over 500
- Area: approximately 240,000 km² (roughly the same size as Honshu, Japan)
- Expansion rate: accelerating year by year

### 3.3.2 Social disharmony

Widening economic disparity

**Current situation (2025):**

- The top 1% of the wealthy own about 45% of the world's wealth
- The bottom 50% own only about 2% of the world's wealth
- Gini coefficient: In many countries, it exceeds 0.4 (the warning line for inequality)

**problem:**

- Social instability
- Inequality of opportunity
- Health disparities
- Educational disparities
- Perpetuation of intergenerational inequalities

International conflict

**Conflict over resources:**

- Water resources (Nile River, Mekong River, etc.)
- Energy resources (oil, natural gas)
- Rare metals and rare earths
- Fishery resources

**Climate change responsibility:**

- Historical emitters vs. current emitters
- Developed countries vs. developing countries
- Conflicts over who should bear the costs of countermeasures

### 3.3.3 Personal disharmony

#### Mental health crisis

**Pathologies of modern society:**

Depression and anxiety disorders:

- WHO estimates: Over 300 million people worldwide
- Increasing in developed countries
- Rapid increase among young people

suicide:

- Approximately 700,000 people per year (WHO statistics)
- Japan: Approximately 20,000 people per year (declining but still at a high level)

Death and suicide from overwork:

- International attention given to a problem unique to Japan
- Normalization of long working hours

**Root cause:**

- Excessive stress in a competitive society
- Weakening of human relationships
- Loss of meaning in life
- Loss of connection with nature

-----

3.4 Deviation from cycles

### 3.4.1 Linear Economic Systems

#### "Collect → Produce → Consume → Dispose" model

**Basic Structure of the Modern Economy:**

1.
Resource extraction (mines, oil fields, forests, etc.)
↓
2. Mass production (factories)
↓ 3. Mass consumption
(markets)
↓
4. Mass disposal (garbage)
↓
End (no circulation)

**Problem:**

Entrance issues:

- Resource depletion
- Environmental destruction due to mining
- Energy consumption

Exit issues:

- Accumulation of waste
- Environmental pollution
- CO2 emissions

### 3.4.2 The Tragedy of Plastic

#### Production and disposal

**current situation:**

- Annual production: Approximately 400 million tons
- Cumulative production (1950-2020): Approximately 10 billion tons
- Recycling rate: Only 9%
- Incineration: 12%
- Landfill/discharge to the environment: 79%

**Marine plastic pollution:**

- Annual inflow: Approximately 8 million tons
- Accumulated amount: Approximately 150 million tons
- Microplastics: Spreading throughout the Earth
- Bioaccumulation: Ends up in the food chain and reaches the human body

**The essence of the problem:**

- Not decomposed (survives for hundreds of years)
- Not circulated
- Accumulates

### 3.4.3 Linearizing the food system

#### Traditional circular agriculture

```
Crops → Food → Waste → Compost → Farmland → Crops
↓
Complete
Cycle```

**Japan in the Edo Period:**

- Transporting urban waste to rural areas
- Using it as fertilizer
- Nearly 100% nutrient circulation

Modern linear agriculture


Chemical fertilizers (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium) are applied to farmland ,
then crops are produced , transported to cities , consumed , treated in sewage, and released into the ocean. The end (no recycling) .












**Problem:**

Nitrogen excess:

- Excessive use of chemical fertilizers
- Runoff into rivers and oceans
- Eutrophication → Red tide and dead zones

Phosphorus depletion:

- Phosphate rock is a limited resource
- Recoverable period: about 100 years
- No substitute (phosphorus is essential for life)

-----

## 3.5 Deviations from Structure

### 3.5.1 The Dominance of Short-Term Thinking

#### Short-term politics

The downside of the election cycle:

- Term: 2-6 years
- Perspective: Until the next election
- Policy: Prioritize short-term effects

**result:**

- Postponing long-term problems
- Repeated symptomatic treatment
- Abandoning structural reform

**Example: Climate change measures**

Required measures:

- 50-100 year perspective
- Short-term costs
- Long-term benefits

Political Reality:

- Prioritizing the election four years from now
- Emphasizing short-term interests of voters
- Postponing measures

#### Short-term economics

**The Curse of Quarterly Earnings:**

- Reporting cycle: 3 months
- Perspective: Next quarter
- Evaluation: Short-term benefits

**result:**

- Reduced long-term investment
- Reduced R&D costs
- Ignorance of environmental costs

### 3.5.2 The trap of suboptimization

The pros and cons of specialization

**Achievements:**

- Deep expertise
- Advanced technology
- Increased efficiency

**Crime:**

- Narrowing of perspective
- Lack of integrated thinking
- Loss of the big picture

**Example: Divided measures to combat global warming**

Energy Experts:

- "We just need to increase renewable energy."

Forestry expert:

- "We just need to increase forest cover."

Marine Experts:

- "We can utilize the ocean's absorption capacity."

**problem:**

- Each is correct
- But they are not integrated
- Interactions are not seen
- Overall optimization is not achieved

### 3.5.3 Fragile Structures

Just-in-time vulnerabilities

**Designed for efficiency:**

Zero inventory
→ Cost reduction
↓
However
↓
In the event of a disaster or pandemic
↓
Supply chain disruption
↓
Social functions come to a
halt```

**Real-life example: COVID-19 pandemic**

- Mask shortages
- Medical supply shortages
- Semiconductor shortages
- Food shortages

**Lessons learned:**

- Efficiency ≠ Robustness
- The need for redundancy
- The importance of backups

The dangers of relying on a single power source

**Modern society's dependence on electricity:**

Everything
runs on electricity
↓ Power
outage
↓
Social
paralysis

**Real-life examples:**

- Hokkaido Blackout (2018)
- Texas Blackout (2021)
- California Rolling Blackout (2019-)

**Problem Structure:**

- Centralized power source
- Lack of backup
- Lack of decentralization

-----

3.6 Root Cause Analysis

### 3.6.1 Ideological roots

#### Anthropocentrism

**Basic philosophy:**

- Humans are the center of all things
- Nature exists for humans
- Human interests come first

**result:**

- Instrumentalization of nature
- Justification of environmental destruction
- Disregard for other life forms

#### Growth supremacy

**Basic philosophy:**

- Growth is good
- Increasing GDP is happiness
- Expansion is progress

**result:**

- Pursuit of infinite growth (on a finite earth)
- Externalization of environmental costs
- Ignorance of unsustainability

#### Individualism/Egoism

**Basic philosophy:**

- Individual freedom is the top priority
- Maximization of self-interest
- Indifference to others and society

**result:**

- Neglect of public goods
- Tragedy of the commons
- Loss of social solidarity

### 3.6.2 Systemic Causes

Market failure

Ignoring external diseconomies:

Corporate
profit calculation:
Revenue - Costs = Profits
.
Costs do not include:
- Costs of environmental destruction
- Costs of climate change
- Costs of health damage
- Costs to future generations
.
These are "externalized" and
borne
by society as a whole .

**Discount Rate Issues:**


Present Value = Future Value / (1 + r)^ t

r = discount rate (usually 3-5%)
t = number of years

Example: r=5%, t=100 years
in the future: 1 million yen = approximately 760 yen today
. ↓
A loss of 100 million yen in 100 years = 76,000 yen today .
↓
The huge future loss is underestimated
.

The limits of democracy

**Majority Rule:**

advantage:

- Reflection of majority opinion
- Dispersal of power

limit:

- Minority rights
- Rights of future generations (no voting rights)
- Disregard for expertise (populism)
- Prioritization of short-term interests

### 3.6.3 Knowledge Fragmentation

#### Increasing specialization

**Development of modern science:**

17th
century: Universal scholar (jack of all trades)
↓
19th century: Establishment of specialization
↓
20th century: Further specialization
↓ 21st century
: Hyperspecialization

**result:**

- Deep knowledge (vertical)
- Narrow perspective (horizontal lack)
- Difficulty in integration

Loss of an integrated perspective

**problem:**

Complex issues (climate change, environmental degradation, etc.) are:

- Cross-disciplinary
- Interaction is important
- Understanding the big picture is necessary

but:

- Experts are limited to their own fields
- No one integrates
- Overall optimization is not achieved

-----

## 3.7 Crossroads of Civilization

### 3.7.1 Precursors of Collapse

**Historical Patterns**

The collapse of civilization will not be sudden, but there will be signs:

1. **Resource depletion**
1. **Environmental degradation**
1. **Social instability**
1. **Dividing elites and the masses**
1. **The dominance of short-term thinking**
1. **Ignoring warnings**
1. **Collapse**

**Current state of modern civilization:**

1. ✓ Signs of resource depletion (peak oil, water shortages, etc.)
1. ✓ Environmental deterioration (climate change, loss of biodiversity, etc.)
1. ✓ Social instability (widening inequality, political division, etc.)
1. ✓ Widening division
1. ✓ Dominance of short-term thinking
1. ✓ Ignorance of warnings (IPCC reports, etc.)
1. **? ** (still avoidable)

### 3.7.2 Time Danger

**Master Inference (detailed in Part 3):**


Time remaining: about 5 years (2025-2030) Reason
:
time lag (20-30 years) Start
in
2030 Effects will be seen in 2050-2060 Will it be just in time ?





**but:**

```
Start in 2035
↓
Effects will be seen in 2055-2065
↓ Too
late```

-----

## 3.8 The Possibility of Hope

### 3.8.1 Changes in Perception

**Pessimistic Reality:**

The problem is serious. Time is short.

**but:**

Recognizing a problem is the first step to solving it.

### 3.8.2 Technical possibilities

**Ocean Breathing System Example:**

- Technically feasible
- Economically sustainable
- Ecologically sound
- Large-scale deployment possible

**Other technologies:**

- Renewable energy
- Circular agriculture
- Urban redesign
- It's all possible

### 3.8.3 Structural hope

**Hope is not a feeling, it's a structure.**

What you'll need:

1. Return to the four principles
1. Implement the subsidiarity principle
1. Implement technology
1. Redesign the system

It's not that they "can't" do these things, it's just that they "don't."

-----

## 3.9 Summary

Modern civilization has seriously deviated from four fundamental principles:

1. **Ignorance of Providence**: Disregard for the laws of nature
1. **Loss of Harmony**: Disharmony with nature, society, and oneself
1. **Destruction of Cycles**: Dominance of Linear Systems
1. **Lack of Structure**: Short-term thinking, partial optimization, vulnerability

The root cause is:

- Ideological: anthropocentrism, growth-firstism, selfishness
- Systemic: market failure, limits to democracy
- Intellectual: specialization, lack of integration

but:

- The problem is being recognized
- Technological solutions exist
- Change is possible

There is little time left, but there is still time.

The next part, Part III, will further deepen our understanding of the current situation and clarify the nonlinear progression and urgency of global warming.

## 4.1 Current CO2 concentration

###October 2025 observation data

Atmospheric CO2 concentration:

```
As of October 2025: Approximately 425-430 ppm (0.0425-0.043%)

Detailed data (NOAA Mauna Loa Observatory):

↓
Rate of increase: Approximately 0.5 ppm/year (initial)
↓
Present: 2-3 ppm/year
↓
100-300 times the natural
rate

4.2 IPCC forecast model

### 4.2.1 Sixth Assessment Report (AR6, 2021-2023)

Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSP) Scenario:

#### SSP1-1.9 (best-case scenario)

```
Assumptions:
- Immediate and strict emissions reductions
- Net zero by 2050
- Large-scale reforestation
- Implementation of carbon capture technologies

CO2 concentration in 2100:
Approximately 350-450 ppm (lower than today)

Temperature rise:
+1.5°C or less (compared to pre-industrial levels
)

#### SSP2-4.5 (Intermediate Scenario)

```
Assumptions:
- Gradual emissions reductions
- Net zero around 2070
- Continuation of current policies

CO2 concentration in 2100:
Approximately 550-650 ppm

Temperature rise:
+2.5-3℃
```

SSP3-7.0 (High Emissions Scenario)

Assumptions
:
- Slow emissions reductions
- Continued dependence on fossil fuels
- Limited international cooperation

CO2 concentration in 2100:
Approximately 800-900 ppm

Temperature rise:
+3.5-4.5℃
```

#### SSP5-8.5 (worst case scenario)

```
Assumptions:
- No emissions reductions
- Increased fossil fuel use
- Prioritizing economic growth

CO2 concentration in 2100:
Approximately 1100-1200 ppm

Temperature rise:
+4.5-5.5℃ or
more```

4.2.2 Assumptions of the IPCC model

**Basic assumptions:**

1. **Linearity Assumption**

- Emissions and concentrations are proportional
- Feedback is limited
- Tipping points are considered but modest

1. **Sink stability**

- Forest CO2 absorption: almost the same
- Ocean CO2 absorption: gradually decreasing
- Soil carbon storage: slightly decreasing

1. **Policy optimism**

- International cooperation is functioning
- Technological development is progressing smoothly
- Social consensus can be formed

-----

## 4.3 Mastering Inference (Nonlinear Prediction)

### 4.3.1 Differences in basic assumptions

**IPCC model:**

Linear
thinking
:
Extending current trends
;
Maintaining
sinks

**Master Inference:**


Nonlinear thinking :
Acceleration at
the tipping point , decay of sinks and conversion to sources



### 4.3.2 Master Inference Prediction

**CO2 concentration prediction:**

2025
: 425-430 ppm (current level)
2030: 450-470 ppm
2040: 520-550 ppm
2050: 600 ppm (0.06%)
2060: 700 ppm (0.07%)
2070: 900 ppm (0.09%)
2090: 1200 ppm (0.12%)
2100: 1300-1500
ppm

**Comparison:**

IPCC
worst-case scenario (SSP5-8.5):
1100-1200 ppm in 2100

Master inference:
1200 ppm in 2090 (10 years early)
1300-1500 ppm in 2100 (even worse)
```

### 4.3.3 Acceleration Mechanism

**Why accelerate:**

#### 1. Decrease in sinks

**forest:**


Previously: CO2 sink (absorbs approximately 1.5 billion tons per year) ↓
Present
: Declining absorption capacity
↓
Near future: Neutralization ↓ Future: Shift to emission source



**Ocean:**

Previously
: CO2 sink (absorbs approximately 2.5 billion tons per year)
↓
Impacts of global warming:
- Rising sea surface temperature → Decreased solubility
- Strengthened stratification → Cessation of vertical circulation
- Decrease in plankton → Decrease in photosynthesis
↓
Absorption capacity: Decreasing year by year ↓
Around
2050: Possible 50% decrease

#### 2. New sources of emissions

**Permafrost:**

Area
: Approximately 24 million km² (approximately 24% of the Earth's land area)
Carbon storage: Approximately 1,700 gigatons Melts due to
global
warming
Releases
methane and CO2
Greenhouse
effect of methane: Approximately 28 times that of CO2 (100-year scale )
Exponential
acceleration

**Forest fire:**

Previously
, approximately 2 billion tons of CO2 were emitted annually (natural fires).
Global
warming led to increased emissions:
- Drying → increased flammability
- Heat waves → increased ignition risk
- Forest stress → increased mortality
.
2024-2025: Record-breaking large-scale fires
.
2050 forecast: 4-6 billion tons per year. Shifting
from
a sink to a source
.

#### 3. Positive Feedback Loop

**Self-reinforcing global warming:**

```
Increase in CO2
↓ Global
warming
↓
├→ Decrease in ocean absorption capacity → Increase in CO2 (loop 1)
├→ Increase in forest fires → Increase in CO2 (loop 2)
├→ Melting permafrost → Methane release → Accelerated warming (loop 3)
├→ Decrease in sea ice → Decrease in albedo → Accelerated warming (loop 4)
└→ Increase in water vapor → Strengthened greenhouse effect → Accelerated warming (loop 5)
↓
Further increase in CO2
↓
(Accelerated vicious cycle)
```

4.4 Validating Predictions

### 4.4.1 Historical Similarities

**Past rapid warming events:**

#### PETM (Paleocene-Eocene Thermal Maximum)

```
Time: Approximately 56 million years ago
Duration: Approximately 200,000 years
CO2 increase: Unknown (estimated 1000-3000 ppm)
Temperature rise: 5-8°C (global average)
Mechanism: Mass release of methane hydrate (hypothesis)
↓
Mass extinction: Approximately 50% of marine life
↓
Recovery: Approximately 100,000 years or
more```

**Lessons learned:**

- Rapid CO2 increase → Large-scale climate change
- Positive feedback → Accelerated change
- Extremely long recovery time required

Rapid warming at the end of the last glacial period

```
Time: Approximately 15,000-11,000 years ago
CO2 increase: Approximately 100 ppm (180 → 280)
Temperature increase: Approximately 6°C (global average)
Duration: Approximately 4,000 years
↓
However, the current rate is much faster than
this```

### 4.4.2 Lessons from glacial-interglacial cycles

**Data from the past 800,000 years:**

CO2
fluctuation: 180-280 ppm (100 ppm range)
Temperature fluctuation: Approximately 6°C
↓
100 ppm CO2 fluctuation ≈ 6°C temperature fluctuation
↓
In other words
, CO2 sensitivity: Approximately
0.06°C/ppm

**Application to the current situation:**


Pre-industrial Revolution: 280 ppm
Present: 425 ppm
Increase: 145 ppm
↓
Predicted temperature rise: 145 × 0.06 = approx. 8.7°C
↓
But the current rise is only approx. 1.5°C
↓
Why? ` `
`

**Answer: Time lag**

```
CO2 increase → Reasons why warming takes time
:
- Ocean thermal inertia (huge heat capacity)
- Ice sheet melting (takes time)
- Ecosystem response (delay)
↓
Estimated time lag: 20-30 years
↓
In other words
↓
The warming we see now is
the result of CO2 increases 20-30 years ago
↓ There is a possibility of a further 5-7°C rise
in the next 20-30 years```


### 4.4.3 Consistency with recent observational data

**2020-2025 Anomalies:**

Record high temperatures


2023: Hottest year on record
2024: Possibly surpassing 2023
2025: Further record-breaking forecast

4.5 Limitations of the IPCC model

4.5.1 Linearity Assumption

**Problem:**

The climate system is inherently nonlinear (chaotic)
↓
Behavior that cannot be predicted by linear models
↓
Sudden changes at tipping points
↓
Cannot be captured by conventional models

Lorentz's discovery (1963):

Weather is deterministic chaos
↓
Slight differences in initial conditions
↓
lead to unpredictable results
↓
"Butterfly effect"

### 4.5.2 Underestimating the Tipping Point

**IPCC's cautious stance:**

reason:

- Demand for scientific certainty
- Political considerations
- Conservative predictions

result:

- Underestimation of risks
- Diminished sense of urgency
- Delay in taking measures

Changes in AR6:

Previously: Tipping point is a "possibility"
AR6: Tipping point is a "real risk"
↓
Perceptions are changing, but still insufficient

### 4.5.3 Neglect of sink decay

**IPCC assumptions**

Absorption capacity of forests and oceans:

- Gradually decreasing
- but sustained

**reality:**

Amazon:

2021
Study (Nature):
Some regions have already become net emitters
, potentially
exceeding the tipping point

Ocean:

Dead zone
expansion: Accelerating year by year
Vertical circulation cessation: Widespread observation
Plankton decline: Ongoing
↓
Rapid decline in absorption capacity

- Cooling due to melting ice sheets
- Cooling effect of aerosols

**Realistic Expectations:**

2050
(600 ppm): +3-4°C
2100: +6-8°C
Equilibrium (several hundred years later): +10-15°

## 4.8 Summary

### IPCC Model vs. Master Inference

**IPCC model:**

- Linear projection
- Conservative assumption
- Assuming sinks are maintained
- 2100: 1100-1200 ppm (worst case)

**Master Inference:**

- Nonlinear projection
- Considering tipping points
- Factoring in the decay of sinks
- 2090: 1200 ppm
- 2100: 1300-1500 ppm

### Conclusion

The master reasoning is:

- More realistic
- Mechanism-based
- Consistent with recent observations
- More accurately reflects the urgency

but:

- There is hope
- If you take action, you can make a difference
- We will look at the tipping point in more detail in the next chapter

**Tipping point:**

When a system
crosses a certain threshold,
irreversible
changes occur
, leading to
an irreversible,
self-reinforcing,
accelerating
process.

**Metaphor:**

```
A glass of water

Tilt → Tilt → Tilt
↓
Up to a certain angle: Water stays in place
↓
The moment it exceeds the critical angle
↓
Water overflows all at once
↓
It cannot be returned to its original position
````

### 5.1.2 Climate System Tipping Points

**Features:**

1. **The existence of a threshold**

- When a certain temperature and CO2 concentration is exceeded
, dramatic changes begin.

1. **Positive Feedback**

- Change drives change
- Self-reinforcing
- Accelerating

1. **Irreversibility**

- Once started, it cannot be stopped
- It cannot be reversed
- It is permanent on a human timescale

1. **Unpredictability**

- The exact threshold is unknown
- It is difficult to predict when it will occur
- It is only noticed after it has occurred

5.4 Ocean Tipping Points

### 5.4.1 Atlantic Meridional Circulation (AMOC)

#### mechanism

**Key to ocean circulation:**

```
"Ocean Conveyor Belt"

North Atlantic:
Warm surface water moves north
↓
Density increases due to cooling and salt concentration
↓
Sinks to the depths
↓ Moves
south as deep water
↓
Circulates via the Indian and Pacific Oceans
````

**Importance:**

- Maintaining a warm climate in Europe
- Global distribution of heat and nutrients
- Transport of CO2 to the deep ocean

#### Evidence of weakening

**Observation data:**

1980s
: 100% strength (standard)
2000s: Approximately 85%
2020s: Approximately 75-80%
↓
Weakening by approximately 15-25%
↓
Accelerating
trend```

**Cause:**

1.
Melting of the Greenland ice sheet
↓
Increased freshwater inflow
↓
Decrease in seawater salinity
↓
Decrease in density
↓
Decrease in sinking force

2. Rising sea surface temperature
↓
Decrease in density due to temperature
↓
Decrease in sinking force
````

#### Tipping Point Terror

**Critical point:**

Researcher
estimates:
Approximately 40-50% weakening leads to irreversible shutdown
.
Current state: 15-25% weakening
,
approaching danger zone
.

**Impact of stopping:**

Regional
impacts:
- Europe: sudden cooling (more than -10°C)
- North America east coast: accelerated sea level rise
- West Africa: monsoon collapse

Global impacts:
- Accelerated tropical warming
- Drastic changes in rainfall patterns
- Increased oxygen depletion in the oceans - Suspension
of nutrient cycling

**Historical Precedent:**

Younger
Dryas period (approximately 12,900-11,700 years ago)
↓
Glacier lake outburst → Massive inflow of freshwater
↓
AMOC cessation
↓
Sudden cooling of the Northern Hemisphere (-10°C or more within several decades)
↓
Continued for approximately 1,200
years```

### 5.4.2 Ocean Dead Zones

#### current situation

**What is a dead zone?**


Extremely low dissolved oxygen (<2 mg/L) :
Most
marine life becomes unviable
, leading to
ecosystem collapse
.

**Expansion reality:**

1960s
: Approximately 50 locations
2000s: Approximately 400 locations
2020s: Approximately 700 locations or more
↓
Area: Approximately 240,000 km² (roughly the area of ​​Honshu)
↓
Expansion accelerating every
year```

#### Cause

Two mechanisms:

1. Eutrophication:


Agricultural wastewater (nitrogen and phosphorus) flows into coastal waters
, causing massive plankton proliferation , death and sinking , decomposition at the bottom , oxygen consumption , and anoxic conditions .












1. **Stratification due to global warming:**

Rising sea
surface temperatures
↓
Increasing density difference between the surface and deep layers ↓
Cessation
of vertical mixing (convection)

Cessation of oxygen supply to the deep layers
↓
Deoxygenation of the deep layers

#### Tipping Point

**Positive Feedback:**

Global
warming
↓
Strengthened stratification
↓
Stopped vertical circulation
↓
├→ Stopped rising nutrients → Decrease in surface plankton → Decrease in CO2 absorption

melts
.
Organic matter begins to decompose
.
Aerobic decomposition releases CO2.
Anaerobic decomposition releases methane
. Greenhouse effect of methane: Approximately 28 times that of CO2 (100 years), approximately 84 times ( 20
years).

**Current Emissions:**

Estimate

├→ Accelerated melting of the Greenland ice sheet → Further weakening of the AMOC (loop)
├→ Accelerated melting of permafrost → Methane release → Accelerated warming (loop)
└→ Strengthened ocean stratification → Expansion of the dead zone
↓
(Multiple loops intertwine)
```

### 5.7.2 "Hothouse Earth" Scenario

**Steffen et al. (2018) Warning:**

If we
exceed +2°C, a chain of tipping points
will occur, leading to uncontrollable warming , creating a "Hothouse Earth." Final temperature: +4-5°C or higher , putting the survival of human civilization at risk .

Margin: Just 0-1°C
↓
At the current emission rate:
+2°C will be reached in 10-20 years

even if we start taking action now,
the effects will only be seen in 2045-2055↓There is a possibility that
the
tipping point will be exceeded by 2050

Increase in
plankton
↓
Absorption of CO2: billions of tons per year (at large scale deployment)

6.1 Understanding the Nature of Time

### 6.1.1 Three timelines

To understand climate change, it is necessary to distinguish between three different timescales:

1.
Time of emission
- Time of CO2 emission
- Controllable by humans

2. Time of accumulation
- Time it takes for CO2 to accumulate in the atmosphere
- Lifespan of CO2: hundreds to thousands of years

3. Response time (lag) - the time it takes
for the climate system to respond
- 20-30 years

### 6.1.2 The Importance of Time Lag

**The most overlooked element:**

Today
's CO2 emissions are
not
today's warming
, but
warming in 20-30 years
.

**On the flip side:**

Today 's
global warming
is
the result of CO2 emissions 20-30 years ago
.

Why does the time lag occur?

1. **Thermal Inertia of the Ocean**

The ocean
has a huge heat capacity
.
It takes time to warm up
.
Heat travels to the depths: decades
.

1. **Ice Sheet Response Time**


Ice sheet melting: Slow progress ↓
Complete equilibrium
: Hundreds to thousands of years

1. **Ecosystem Response**


Forest change: decades; species
migration: decades to
centuries

## 6.2 Basis for the "five-year grace period"

### 6.2.1 Basics of Calculation

**Prerequisite:**

````
Target: Avoid tipping point (+2°C)
Current situation: +1.5°C (2025)
Margin: 0.5°C
Time lag: 20-30
years```

**Counter-calculation:**

```
We want to avoid a temperature rise of +2°C in 2050
↓
Considering a time lag of 20-30 years
↓
Measures need to start between 2020 and 2030
↓
Currently it's 2025
↓
Remaining: Approximately 5
years```

### 6.2.2 Further Analysis

**Relationship between CO2 concentration and temperature:**

Pre- industrial
Revolution: 280 ppm → Reference temperature
Present (2025): 425 ppm → +1.5°C
↓
145 ppm increase = 1.5°C rise
↓
Sensitivity: approx. 0.01°C/ppm

To reach the target of +2°C:
0.5°C margin
↓
Allowable CO2 increase: Approximately 50 ppm
↓
Target concentration: Approximately 475 ppm
```

**Current growth rate:**


Annual increase: 2-3 ppm
↓
Up to 475 ppm:
(475 - 425) / 2.5 = approximately 20 years
↓
Reached around 2045
↓
But with a 20-30 year lag
↓
Temperatures will not reach +2°C until 2065-2075 ```
`

**At first glance, it looks like you have plenty of room:**

Problem
1: Nonlinear acceleration
- Acceleration at the tipping point
- There is no guarantee that the current rate of increase of 2.5 ppm/year will be maintained
- Further acceleration due to a decline in the absorption capacity of forests and oceans

Problem 2: The time lag paradox
- Even if CO2 emissions are stopped in 2045
, global warming will continue until 2065-2075
- therefore, countermeasures must begin no later than 2025-2030
.

### 6.2.3 "2030 will be a watershed year"

**IPCC Special Report (2018):**

"
To limit global warming to 1.5°C, we need
to reduce CO2 emissions by 45% compared to 2010 by 2030 and
achieve net zero by 2050. "


**reality:**

```
Progress as of 2025:
- Compared to 2010: Approximately 10% increase (rather than reduction)
- Net zero declarations: Many countries have made these declarations
, but their effectiveness is
questionable```

**therefore:**

```
+1.5℃ target: Already nearly impossible
↓
+2℃ target: Still possible, but time is running out
↓
Large-scale measures must be initiated by 2030
↓
Currently 2025
↓
Remaining: Approximately 5
years```

## 6.3 Master Inference Timeline

### 6.3.1 Pessimistic Scenario (No Countermeasures)

**CO2 concentration trends:**

2025
: 425 ppm (status quo)
2030: 450 ppm (+25, 5 ppm acceleration per year)
2035: 480 ppm (+30, further acceleration)
2040: 520 ppm (+40, tipping effect)
2050: 600 ppm (+80, start of runaway)
2060: 700 ppm (+100, out of control)
2070: 900 ppm (+200, catastrophic) 2090
: 1200 ppm (+300, hell)

**Temperature rise transition (considering time lag):**

2025
: +1.5°C (current situation)
2030: +1.7°C
2040: +2.0°C (past tipping point)
2050: +2.5°C
2060: +3.0°C
2070: +4.0°C (effect of CO2 in 2050)
2080: +5.5°C (effect of CO2 in 2060)
2100: +7-8°C (effect of CO2 in 2070-80
)

**Impact on Human Civilization:**

2030s
:
- Extreme weather becoming commonplace
- Food production becoming unstable
- Water resource crisis expanding

2040s:
- Large-scale climate refugees (hundreds of millions)
- Frequent outbreak of conflicts
- Disruption of the economic system

2050s:
- Partial collapse of civilization
- Beginning of population decline
- Collapse of nations

From the 2060s onwards:
- Drastic decline in habitable areas
- Human survival itself is at
risk```

### 6.3.2 Desired scenario (large-scale countermeasures implemented)

**Assumption:**

2025-2030
:
- Large-scale deployment of Ocean Breathing Systems (100,000 units)
- Rapid transition to renewable energy
- Reforestation program - Implementation
of carbon capture technology

**CO2 concentration trends:**

2025
: 425 ppm (current)
2030: 440 ppm (+15, growth rate begins to slow)
2035: 450 ppm (+10, further slowdown)
2040: 455 ppm (+5, roughly flat)
2050: 450 ppm (-5, starts to decline)
2060: 430 ppm (-20, stabilized)
2070: 410 ppm (-20, continues to decline)
2100: 380 ppm (pre-industrial revolution +100 ppm, acceptable range
)

**Temperature rise transition (considering time lag):**

2025
: +1.5°C (current situation)
2030: +1.7°C (still rising, time lag)
2040: +2.0°C (peak, just barely)
2050: +2.0°C (flat, measures taken in the 2030s)
2060: +1.9°C (starts to decline, measures taken in the 2040s)
2070: +1.7°C (stabilized) 2100
: +1.5°C (within acceptable limits)

**Impact on Human Civilization:**

```
2030s:
- The impacts of climate change will continue but be manageable
- Transition to a renewable energy economy
- Beginning of the construction of a sustainable social system

2040s:
- Overcoming the peak of global warming
- Establishing a recycling-based society
- Beginning of ecosystem recovery

2050s and beyond:
- Stable climate
- Sustainable civilization - Harmony
with nature

### 6.3.3 Branching point of the two scenarios

**The choices made between 2025 and 2030 will determine everything:**

Large-scale countermeasures to be implemented between
2025 and 2030 YES → Hopeful scenario NO → Pessimistic scenario Corrections are difficult after the split 2030 will be too late

## 6.4 The brutal truth about time lag

### 6.4.1 The "unknown future" problem

**Human cognitive biases:**

What
is visible: the current state.
What is invisible: the state 20-30 years from
now.
The present is relatively stable
.
Lack of a sense of crisis . Delayed countermeasures
. However , the world 20-30 years from now is already determined by today's actions .








**analogy:**

Titanic
​

An iceberg is discovered
,
the ship changes course
,
but the huge ship does not turn immediately (inertia) , and
there is a time lag before the collision occurs , requiring early steering to avoid it .






### 6.4.2 "Promised Global Warming"

**Global warming already "promised":**


CO2 emissions over the past 20-30 years have not
yet
been reflected in the climate system
. They will
become apparent over the next 20-30 years
.
Even if CO2 emissions were reduced to zero today
,
an additional 0.3-0.5°C of warming would be unavoidable
.

**current situation:**


Current: +1.5°C
Promised warming: +0.3-0.5°C
↓
Total: +1.8-2.0°C
↓
Possibility of already reaching tipping point (+2°C)
`` `

### 6.4.3 "Negative Legacy"

**Current Generation Emissions:**

Emissions
in 2025
: Global warming in
2045-2055 : Further
CO2 lifetime: hundreds to thousands of years , impacting generations hundreds of years from now .






**Intergenerational injustice:**

Benefits of emissions
: enjoyed by the current generation
Burdens of impacts: borne by future generations
↓
Ethical
issues

-----

## 6.5 Gradually Understanding "It's Too Late"

### 6.5.1 Three "too late"

**Level 1: Too late to achieve your ideal goal**

The
+1.5°C target
is
already nearly impossible (as of 2025)
but
not yet catastrophic
.

**Level 2: Too late for acceptable goals**

```
+2℃ target
↓
It will be too late to start measures after 2030
↓
The tipping point will be exceeded and it will become uncontrollable
↓
Present (2025): Just in
time```

**Level 3: Too late for civilization**

"
+4-5°C or higher
:
Human civilization will be difficult to sustain
.
Starting countermeasures after 2040 will be too late . However , the impact will not be catastrophic
. Survival of the human species will be possible ."




### 6.5.2 Current Location

As
of 2025:

Level 1: Already exceeded (+1.5°C is almost inevitable)
Level 2: Just before the limit (5 more years)
Level 3: Still some leeway (15-20 more years)
↓
In other words
↓
Best future: Lost
Good future: Still possible
Catastrophic future: Still
avoidable```

-----

## 6.6 The specific meaning of "5 years"

### 6.6.1 What is needed between 2025 and 2030?

**Technical Implementation:**

```
Ocean Breathing System:
- 2025-26: Prototype demonstration
- 2027: Start of mass production (100 units/year)
- 2028: Expansion (1,000 units/year)
- 2029-30: Large-scale deployment (10,000 units/year)
↓
Cumulative total by 2030: Approximately 20,000 units

Renewable energy:
- Solar and wind power: Triple annual installed capacity
- Fossil fuels: Finalized phase-out plan

Reforestation: 1 million hectares per year ( 10
times the current level)

Social Change:

Policies
:
- Introduction and strengthening of carbon tax
- Elimination of fossil fuel subsidies
- Large-scale investment in renewable energy

Economy:
- Transition to a circular economy
- Expanding green investments
- Sustainable financial systems

Society:
- Lifestyle change
- Education and awareness-
Strengthening international
cooperation

### 6.6.2 Why 5 years? (Review)

**Physical reasons:**

There's
a 20-30 year time lag
.
The state of affairs in 2050 will be determined by actions
taken between 2020
and 2030. To avoid a 2°C rise in 2050, measures must begin by 2030 at the latest .





**Technical reason:**

Large -
scale system deployment:
Concept → Demonstration → Mass production → Deployment
↓
Normally: 10-20 years
↓
Even with emergency acceleration: 5-10 years
↓
If starting in 2030
↓
Effectiveness in 2040-2050
↓ Considering the time lag ,
results in 2060-2080
↓
Too late```

**Tipping Point Reasons:**

Many
tipping points: Around +2°C
↓
Current situation: +1.5°C
↓
Current pace: +2°C in 10-20 years
↓
Accelerating past tipping points
↓ Action needed now before things get
out of control

## 6.7 Between Hope and Despair

### 6.7.1 Reasons for Not Being Optimistic

**reality:**

1.
Lack of political will
- Conflicting interests among countries
- Dominance of short-term thinking
- Rise of populism

2. Economic resistance
- vested interests of the fossil fuel industry
- refusal to bear short-term costs
- resistance to structural reform

3. Social inertia
- Resistance to lifestyle changes
- Lack of a sense of urgency
- "Someone will do something about it" mentality

4. Technical challenges
- Large-scale deployment difficult
- Lack of investment - Lack
of infrastructure development

### 6.7.2 Reasons for Hope

**Possibility:**

1.
The technology already exists
- Ocean Breathing System: Implementation possible
- Renewable energy: Cost reduction
- Carbon capture: Practical stage

2. Changing perceptions
- Realized by frequent extreme weather events
- Younger generations' sense of crisis
- Global movement expanding

3. Economic rationality
- Cost competitiveness of renewable energy
- Rising costs of climate disasters
- Growth of the green economy

4. Acceleration of change
- Speed ​​of technological innovation
- Waves of social change
- Existence of tipping points
(not only for negative but also for positive change
)

### 6.7.3 "Structured Hope"

**Not emotional hope:**

"
It will all work out somehow"
↓
This is dangerous optimism

"Someone will do something about it"
↓
This is irresponsible and leaving it to others
````

**Structural hope:**

```
`If we implement this system, we can achieve this effect
mathematically and physically.`` ↓ Ocean Breathing System ↓ CO2 absorption: Calculatable Dead zone elimination: Predictable Large-scale deployment: Implementable ↓ Reproducible Hope```

# Part IV: Technical proposal

## - A regenerative system based on the laws of nature -

-----

# Chapter 7: Ocean Breathing System

-----

## 7.1 Basic principles

### 7.1.1 Vertical circulation in nature

**The original appearance of the ocean:**


Surface layer (0-200m):
- Light reaches (photosynthesis possible)
- Warm
- Low in nutrients (consumed by living organisms )

Deep water (200m or deeper):
- No light reaches
- Cold
- Rich in nutrients (accumulated by decomposition of biological remains)
↓
These two are connected by "vertical circulation
"

**Mechanism of vertical circulation:**


Winter cooling
↓
Increased density of surface water
↓
Sedimentation (downward flow)
↓
Pushing of deep water (upward flow)
↓
Nutrients to the surface
↓
Spring plankton bloom
↓
Photosynthetic explosion
↓
CO2 absorption
↓
Foundation of the marine ecosystem
`` ``

### 7.1.2 Cessation of vertical circulation

**Effects of global warming:**

Rising sea
surface temperatures
↓
Widening density gap between the surface and deep layers
↓
Strengthening stratification
↓
Decreasing or cessation of vertical circulation
↓
Nutrients not reaching the surface
↓
Decrease in plankton
↓
├→ Decreasing CO2 absorption capacity → Accelerating global warming └→ Stopping oxygen supply →
Expanding dead zones```

**Current situation (2025):**


Vertical circulation weakens globally .
Dead
zones: Approximately 700 locations. Area: Approximately
240,000 km². Continuing to expand .



### 7.1.3 The idea behind the Ocean Breathing System

**Question:**

" Can we artificially induce vertical circulation
without waiting for winter cooling ?" " Can we transport nutrient-rich ocean water from the deep ocean to the surface? " "Can we make the ocean breathe? "







**Answer: Deep Sea Aeration**


Air is sent to the deep ocean (250m) ↓
Air
bubbles rise
↓
The surrounding seawater is drawn in (air lift effect)
↓
Deep water comes to the surface
↓
Nutrients are supplied
↓
Plankton is activated
↓
CO2 is fixed
↓
Ocean breathing is
restored```

Solar: 1.2kW (peak) Wind
: 0.4kW (rated)
Tidal: 0.2kW (rated) ↓
Total
: 1.8kW (theoretical peak)

**Average output:**


Solar: 200W (annual average, availability rate 17%) Wind
: 120W (annual average, availability rate 30%) Tidal
: 140W (annual average, availability rate 70%)
Total
: 460W

**Daily power generation:**

460W
x 24h = 11.04 kWh/
day

### 7.3.2 Consumption

**breakdown:**

Compressor
: 5kW x operating time
Control system: 50W x 24h = 1.2 kWh/day
Communication system: 20W x 24h = 0.5 kWh/day
Other: 30W x 24h = 0.7 kWh/day
Basic
consumption (excluding compressor): 2.4 kWh/
day

**Compressor operating time:**

Surplus
power generation: 11.04 - 2.4 = 8.64 kWh/day
.
Compressor operating time:
8.64 kWh / 5 kW = 1.73 h/day.
Approx
. 1.7 hours/day
.

### 7.3.3 Duty Cycle Control

**problem:**

```
I want to operate it continuously
↓
but 1.7 hours/day is not
enough```

**Solution: Intermittent operation**

Pattern 1
: Short-term concentrated
operation: 30 minutes ON
, rest: 30 minutes OFF
.
Actual operation: 12 hours/day (50% duty)
.
Consumption: 5kW x 6h = 30 kWh/day
.
Shortage: 30 - 11.04 = 18.96 kWh/day
.
Impossible
.

**Pattern 2: Long-term dispersion**


Operation: 1 hour ON,
Rest: 2 hours OFF
↓
Cycle: 3 hours
↓ 1
day: 24h / 3h = 8 cycles
↓
Actual operation: 8 hours/day (33% duty)
↓
Consumption: 5kW × 8h = 40 kWh/day
↓
Shortage: 40 - 11.04 = 28.96 kWh/day
↓
Still
insufficient```

**Pattern 3: Use of storage batteries**

On
sunny days:
Large amount of power generated → Compressor operates for a long time → Battery charges

Cloudy days and nighttime:
Low power generation → Battery discharge → Compressor short-time operation

During bad weather:
Power generation is extremely low → Compressor stops → Storage battery is conserved
↓
Balance is maintained on average over three days
````

**Optimal driving pattern:**

Sunny
day:
Compressor: 4 hours operation (20 kWh consumption)
Power generation: 15 kWh
Base consumption: 2.4 kWh
↓
Surplus: 15 - 20 - 2.4 = -7.4 kWh
↓
Refill from storage battery

Cloudy day:
Compressor: 2 hours operation (10 kWh)
Power generation: 8 kWh
Base consumption: 2.4 kWh
↓
Surplus: 8 - 10 - 2.4 = -4.4 kWh
↓
Refill from storage battery

Bad weather day:
Compressor: Stopped
Power generation: 3 kWh
Base consumption: 2.4 kWh
↓
Surplus: 3 - 2.4 = +0.6 kWh
↓
Charging to the storage battery
↓
Balanced on average for the
week```

### 7.3.4 Improvement Options

**Solar panel area expansion:**

```
6m² → 12m² (doubled)
↓
Output: 2.4kW → Average 400W
↓
Daily power generation: +9.6 kWh
↓
Creates a
margin```

**High-efficiency compressor:**

Current
: 5kW
Improved: 3.5kW (30% reduction)
↓ Reduced
power consumption with the same air volume

**Wave energy added:**

```
Using the up and down movement of the floating body
↓
Additional output: 50-100W average
↓
Small increase, but
cumulative```

modern
specialization and fragmentation


### 9.17.4 Philosophy of Hope

**Escape from despair:**

The
climate crisis
invites despair
:
"It's too late.
" "There's no point in trying."
But
an integrated system shows: " There's still time." "There's a way." "It can be implemented.
" A philosophy of hope: structural hope , not emotional hope . Hope based on action .

.








**Smart Risk Taking:**

Recognize the
risks
,
prepare countermeasures
,
execute cautiously but decisively
,
respond quickly when problems arise
,
learn and improve
, and
keep moving forward
-
this is the essence of risk
management .


### 12.10.3 The relationship between hope and risk


Hope is not optimism ;
it
is not ignoring risk
.
Hope is:
recognizing
risk
,
deciding to move forward despite it
,
being prepared to overcome difficulties
, and
being willing to learn from failure
.
This is
structured
hope
.

14.4 Overcoming Barriers

### 14.4.1 Psychological Barriers

**"It doesn't concern me"**

No
, climate change affects everyone , including you and your children
.










**"I'm powerless on my own"**

You
may be small on your own
,
but
you
're not powerless
.
Your actions
will
move others
and
create ripples
.

**"It's too late now."**

No
, there
's
still time.
If
we act between 2025 and 2030
, we'll be
in time for 2050. It's too early to give up .





**"Someone will do it"**


That "someone" is you .
We all need to be "someone. "






### 14.4.2 Practical Barriers

**"I don't have any money"**

It 's
true that an initial investment is necessary
,
but
:
- Energy conservation reduces electricity bills
- Composting reduces fertilizer costs
- Bicycles reduce transportation costs
-
It's beneficial in the long run
- There are
also subsidies and support programs available
.


**"I don't have time"**


I understand you're busy ,
but
it 's a matter of priorities
. Is there anything more important than the future of the Earth ? Also , you don't need a big chunk of time . You can do it in your daily life .












**"I don't know what to do"**

This paper
shows the Ocean Breathing System,
an urban environment improvement system. Specific methods are available . All you have to do is implement it.

14.5 Reaffirming Urgency

### 14.5.1 Countdown

November
2025 (now)
↓ Until
2030: Approximately 5 years
↓
1,825 days
↓
43,800 hours
↓
Every day↓ is
↓
precious
↓
cannot be wasted```

### 14.5.2 Irreversibility

Once
we pass the tipping point
, there's
no going back.
If
the Greenland ice sheet starts to melt
,
it won't stop for hundreds or even thousands of years
. If
the Amazon becomes savanna , it won't return to its original state as a tropical rainforest . Therefore, we must stop it before it passes the tipping point .









### 14.5.3 The cruelty of time lag


Even if we reduce emissions to zero today, global warming will continue for the
next
20-30 years
. This
means that what happens in 2050 will depend on our actions between 2020 and 2030 , so we need to act now .

## 15.7 Space Perspective

### 15.7.1 Stages of Earth Civilization

Kardashev Scale (stages of civilization development):

Type I
: Planetary civilization
- Full utilization of planetary energy
- Climate control
- Sustainable
↓
Humanity is currently at about Type 0.7
↓
Transition to Type I

Type II: Stellar civilization
- Fully utilizes stellar energy
↓
Distant future

Type III: Galactic Civilization
- Fully utilizes galactic energy
↓
Even more distant
future```

**Current Humanity:**

```
Transition to Type I
civilization.
However

it will
become a planetary civilization
.
Ocean Breathing Systems, etc.,
are a step
towards Type I civilization.``

### 15.7.2 Answer to Fermi Paradox

**Fermi Paradox:**

``` ``
Where are aliens?''
↓
The universe is vast
↓ There are
countless stars
↓
The probability of life being born is not low
↓
But
↓
There is no evidence of intelligent life
↓
Why?
```

**One hypothesis: The Great Filter**

When civilization
reaches a certain stage,
it
inevitably faces a challenge (filter)
that causes
most civilizations to collapse. This is why there are no aliens .







**The Great Filter of Humanity:**


Right now
,
climate change is happening
.
Can we overcome it?
If
we do ,
we 'll become a
Type I civilization. If we fail, we'll collapse . This is a test of cosmic history .

Appendix B: Formulas and rationale

### B.1 Calculation of CO2 fixation

B.1.1 Basic Assumptions


Effects of increased nutrients: Nutrient
concentrations at a depth of 250m:
- Nitrate: 10-50 times higher than the surface
- Phosphate: 20-100 times higher than the surface
- Silicate: 50-200 times higher than the surface

Conservative assumption:
10-fold increase in phytoplankton abundance due to increased nutrients

[Area of ​​effect]
Spread by spiral discharge:
Radius 150 m
Area: π × (150)² ≈ 70,000 m² = 0.07 km²
```

B.1.2 Photosynthetic carbon fixation

```
[Primary production]
Primary production in temperate oceans:
Approximately 100-200 gC/m²/year (surface layer)

When nutrient restrictions are lifted:
Approximately 200-300 gC/m²/year

Conservative value:
20 gC/m²/year (nutrient increase only)

[Annual carbon fixation]
Affected area: 70,000 m²
Per unit area: 20 gC/m²/year
↓
Total carbon fixation:
70,000 x 20 = 1,400,000 g = 1,400 kg = 1.4 ton carbon/year

[CO2 conversion]
Molecular weight of carbon: 12
Molecular weight of CO2: 44
Conversion factor: 44/12 ≈ 3.67
↓ Fixed
CO2 amount:
1.4 × 3.67 ≈ 5.1 ton CO2/year
↓
Approximately 5 ton CO2/year/unit (conservative)

B.1.3 Uncertainty

```
[Factors for the upside]
- Plankton increase rate more than 10 times
- The impact range is wider than expected
- Additional fixation by the food chain
↓
Possible actual amount of CO2 5-10 ton/year

[Downward factors]
- Plankton growth rate less than 10 times
- Other limiting factors (light, temperature, etc.)
- Seasonal fluctuations
↓
Worst case: 2-3 ton CO2/year

[Adopted value]
Conservative median value: 5 ton CO2/year/
unit

### B.2 Energy Balance Calculation

B.2.1 Power generation


Solar
Panel Output: 1,200 W (STC) Sunshine
Hours (Equivalent): 4 h/day
Operating Rate: 17% (4/24)
Average Output: 1,200 × 0.17 = 204 W ≈ 200 W

[Wind power]
Rated output: 400 W (total of 4 units)
Average wind speed: 3 m/s
Power coefficient: approx. 0.3 (empirical)
Average output: 400 × 0.3 = 120 W

[Tidal power]
Rated output: 200 W (total of 4 units)
Average flow velocity: 0.3 m/s
Operating rate: 70%
Average output: 200 × 0.7 = 140 W

Total average power:
200 + 120 + 140 = 460 W

Daily power generation:
460 W × 24 h = 11,040 Wh ≈ 11 kWh/
day

#### B.2.2 Consumption

```
[Control system]
Microcomputer and sensor: 30 W
Communication equipment: 20 W
↓
Total: 50 W x 24 h = 1.2 kWh/day

[Compressor]
Rated output: 5 kW
Operating time: Variable (duty cycle control)

[Other]
Lighting and backup: 30 W x 24 h = 0.7 kWh/day

[Basic consumption (excluding compressor)]
1.2 + 0.7 = 1.9 kWh/day ≈ 2 kWh/
day

#### B.2.3 Compressor operating time

```
[Surplus electricity]
Power generation: 11 kWh/day
Basic consumption: 2 kWh/day
Surplus: 9 kWh/day

[Operating time]
9 kWh / 5 kW = 1.8 hours/day

[Duty cycle]
1 hour ON, 2 hours OFF
↓
Effective: 8 hours/day (33% duty)
↓
Consumption: 8 × 5 = 40 kWh/day

[Balance]
Power generation: 11 kWh/day
Consumption: 40 kWh/day
Shortage: 29 kWh/day

[Solution]
Storage battery: 20 kWh
↓
Charge on sunny days
and discharge in bad weather
↓
Balance on average weekly

or

Increased solar panel capacity (doubled to 12 m²)
↓
Average output: 400 W
Daily power generation: approx. 20 kWh/day
↓
Operable with
ease```

### B.3 Economic Calculations

Material costs: $12,000 Labor
costs: $1,500
Equipment depreciation: $1,500
Logistics costs: $500
Other: $1,000
↓
Total: $16,500/
unit

B.3.2 Carbon Credit Revenue

```
CO2 fixation: 5 ton/year/unit
Carbon price: $50/ton (assumed)
↓
Annual revenue: 5 × 50 = $250/unit

1,000 units: $250,000/year
100,000 units: $25,000,000/
year````

#### B.3.3 Payback period (simple calculation)


Cost: $16,500/unit
Annual revenue: $250/unit (carbon credits only)
Payback period: 16,500 /
250 = 66 years

[However]
If other benefits are included:
- Increase in fishery resources: $70/unit/year
- Ecosystem services: $100/unit/year
- Tourism value: $50/unit/year
↓
Total: $470/unit/year
↓
Payback period: 16,500 / 470 ≈ 35 years
↓
Recoverable within the useful life (30-40 years)
````

### B.4 Calculating the Integration Effect

#### B.4.1 CO2 reduction and absorption during global deployment

```
[Ocean Breathing System]
100,000 units × 5 ton/year = 500,000 ton/year (direct)

Restoring ocean absorption capacity:
Current ocean absorption: Approximately 10 billion tons/year
Decrease due to dead zones, etc.: Estimated 10-20%
Recovery effect: 10% improvement
↓
10 billion × 0.1 = 1 billion tons/year

Total: Approximately 1 billion tons/year

[Improving urban environments]
50% of the world's urban population: 2.25 billion people
Urban CO2 emissions: Approximately 70% of the total
↓
Target emissions: 40 billion x 0.7 x 0.5 = 14 billion tons/year

50% reduction rate: 7 billion tons/year
Absorption by urban greening: 500 million tons/year
↓
Total: 7.5 billion tons/year

[Synergy]
Interaction between the two systems: Estimated 1 billion tonnes/year

[Total]
10 + 75 + 10 = 9.5 billion tons/year
↓ Approximately 24
% of current human emissions (approximately 40 billion tons/year)

Appendix E: Frequently Asked Questions

### E.1 Technical Questions

**Q1: ​​Does the Ocean Breathing System really work?**

A
: The basic principles (air lift, vertical circulation) are proven physical phenomena.
All of the individual component technologies (solar power generation, compressors, etc.) have also been put to practical use.
What's new is the "combination method" and the "spiral outlet," but
these are also based on the principles of fluid mechanics and are highly feasible. However
, the actual effects must be confirmed through demonstration tests.

**Q2: Will it be damaged in a typhoon?**

A
: The structural design takes typhoon resistance into consideration (maximum wind speed of 60 m/s is assumed).
The octahedron shape is structurally stable.
However, there is a risk of loss in the event of a typhoon that exceeds the expected magnitude. For
this reason, insurance is provided to cover the loss, and the design is continually improved.
The distributed layout limits the impact on the entire building even if a portion is lost.

**Q3: Won't it stop working due to biofouling?**

A
: Biofouling is unavoidable on marine structures.
As a countermeasure, we apply antifouling paint and clean them regularly (once a year). We
are also considering tolerating some biofouling and positively evaluating it as a fish reef effect.

**Q4: Do you really have enough energy?**

A
: Conservative calculations show that the system is slightly short of capacity, but this
can be achieved by using duty cycle control (intermittent operation) and storage batteries. Also
, doubling the solar panels (to 12m²) will provide ample operating space.
The energy balance will be optimized through demonstration testing.

**Q5: Has the effectiveness of spiral air outlets been proven?**

A
: It is based on the principles of fluid mechanics (Bernoulli effect, Coanda effect), but
the actual improvement in mixing efficiency (10 times) is based on model calculations and inferences. We
will confirm the effect through demonstration tests and optimize the shape as necessary.

### E.2 Environmental Impact Questions

**Q6: Will red tides occur?**

A
: Nutrient supply is localized (within a radius of approximately 150 meters) and
mimics natural upwelling.
Phased deployment and continuous monitoring
will allow for immediate response if there are signs of red tide.
Past upwelling areas (areas with natural nutrient supply)
have been highly productive, and red tides are rare
.

**Q7: Won't this disrupt the ecosystem?**

A
: It assists natural vertical circulation and
basically restores the original state.
However, there is a possibility of unexpected effects, so
we will conduct a thorough environmental impact assessment and conduct continuous monitoring. If any problems arise ,
we will stop operation and take measures.

**Q8: What is the impact on deep-sea creatures?**

A
: The impact of air injection is expected to be limited, but
the demonstration test will also involve surveying deep-sea organisms.
250m depth is the "mesopelagic zone," and the biota there is not as unique as that found in the deep sea (usually 1000m or deeper)
, but we will carefully evaluate the situation
.

### E.3 Economic Questions

**Q9: Is this really economically viable?**

A
: The payback period is approximately 35 years (including multiple benefits), which
is right at the end of the useful life (30-40 years).
If the price of carbon credits rises, the payback period will be shorter.
Also, if you think of it as "insurance" for climate change measures,
the benefits have a value that cannot be measured in monetary terms (the survival of humanity)
.

**Q10: Who will cover the costs?**

A
: We are considering various funding sources:
- Government budget (environmental costs)
- Private investment (green bonds, ESG investments)
- International organizations (climate funds)
- Carbon credit revenues: Initially, public funding will be the main source, but once the effectiveness is proven ,
we expect private funding to take over.

**Q11: Can it be introduced in developing countries?**

A
: This is possible through technology transfer and financial support.
The blueprints will be open source, so they
can be manufactured in various countries. Funding
will come from international climate funds and aid from developed countries.

### E.4 Implementation Questions

**Q12: When can I start?**

A
: Preparations can begin immediately after this paper is published (November 2025).
Once funding and systems are in place, prototype production will begin in Q2 2025.
The first unit is scheduled to be installed in Q4 2025, and demonstration testing will begin
.

**Q13: Can individuals participate?**

A
: Yes, there are many ways to get involved:
- Sharing information (spreading via social media, etc.)
- Providing funding (crowdfunding, etc.)
- Local practice (rooftop greening, composting, etc.)
- Providing expertise (if you are a researcher or engineer)
- Volunteering (events, awareness-raising, etc.) There
is a role for everyone.

**Q14: How can we lobby the government and businesses?**

A
: There are several ways to do this:
- Submit a request to lawmakers or the government
- Contact companies by email or social media
- Propose a proposal at the general meeting of shareholders as a shareholder
- Collect signatures or petitions
- Post in the media
- Express your opinion by voting . The first step
is to speak out.

### E.5 Skeptical Questions

**Q15: Isn't this just another "dream story"?**

```
A: This paper differs from other proposals in the following ways:
1. It uses only existing technology (proven);
2. It presents detailed design specifications
; 3. It calculates and presents economics
; 4. It clearly identifies risks
; 5. It concretely outlines an implementation roadmap;
6. It is open-source and verifiable.
It is not a dream, but a feasible plan.
```

**Q16: Why hasn't anyone done this before?**

A
: There are several reasons:
1. The concept of deep sea aeration existed, but
it was difficult to design an energy self-sufficient system.
2. The economic feasibility was not fully evaluated.
3. The urgency of the climate crisis was not fully recognized.
4. An integrated perspective (ocean + city) was lacking
.

### E.5 Skeptical Questions (cont.)

**Q16: Why hasn't anyone done this before? (continued)**

The technology
was there, but
there had been a lack of effort to integrate it and design it comprehensively, including economics.
The idea of ​​open sourcing is also a new approach. Now
is the time when the urgency and maturity of the technology coincide.

**Q17: Surely the IPCC scientists couldn't have overlooked this?**

A
: The IPCC does an excellent job, but it has the following characteristics:
1. Emphasis on scientific certainty (conservative)
2. Consideration of policy implications (cautious)
3. Focus on reviewing existing research (limited new proposals)

This paper:
- Proposes technical implementation (outside the scope of the IPCC)
- Emphasizes non-linear scenarios (which the IPCC acknowledges but refrains from)
- An integrated approach (multidisciplinary)

It is not intended to negate the IPCC, but rather to complement it
.

**Q18: If the climate crisis could be solved with such a simple solution, it wouldn't be a struggle, right?**

A
: It's not "easy."
It's technically feasible, but implementation would require:
- huge funding ($4.5 trillion)
- 25 years of sustained effort
- international cooperation
- social consensus
- and political determination
.

While technical solutions exist,
the biggest challenge lies in social and political implementation. However
, it is not impossible.
Humanity has overcome great challenges before.

**Q19: What if I fail?**

A
: We recognize the risks (see Chapter 12),
but the risk of failure
is far greater than the risk of doing nothing.

Even if you fail:
- You gain data and lessons learned
- You can apply them to your next attempt
- Even partial success is valuable

If we do nothing:
- The climate crisis will surely worsen
- We will run out of options


Smart risk - taking is what's needed now.

### E.6 Philosophical Questions

**Q20: Isn't human intervention in nature itself a problem?**

A
: Humans are already interfering with nature on a large scale (burning fossil fuels, deforestation, etc.).
The question is the quality of that intervention.

Destructive intervention: Ignoring the laws of nature, one-way, unsustainable.
This proposal: Follows the laws of nature, is circular, and sustainable.

We can't have zero interference with nature (with a population of 8 billion),
so we should intervene wisely.

The Ocean Breathing System is an attempt to restore
the balance of nature that has been disrupted by humans, using human technology to assist in this process .


**Q21: Isn't this just technology-first? Isn't it more important to change our lifestyles?**

A
: You need both, not just one or the other.

This paper also covers:
- Improving urban environments: including lifestyle changes
- Recycling-based society: changing consumption behavior
- Community regeneration: changing social relationships

Technology is a means, not an end in itself.
The goal is a "sustainable civilization,"
which requires both technology and lifestyle changes.

Technology alone is not enough,
nor are lifestyle changes alone enough. An
integrated approach is key.

**Q22: Shouldn't humanity be wiped out? For the sake of the Earth.**

A
: There are two problems with this view:

1. Humans are part of nature.
Humans are not the only "evil" species.

2. Even if humans disappear, the effects of climate change will remain.
The CO2 already released will remain for hundreds of years and
continue to affect other living organisms.

Rather:
human intelligence and technology
should be used to restore, not destroy.

If humanity can build a sustainable civilization, it will be beneficial
for the ecosystem of the entire planet .

Instead of giving up,
we should take responsibility
.

### E.7 Practical Questions

**Q23: Where are the links to GitHub and NOTE?**

A
: It is published at:

GitHub: https://github.com/InchaComisho
NOTE: https://note.com/inchacomusho
X (old Twitter): @rissya0214


We plan to continuously release blueprints, data, programs,
etc.

**Q24: Where can I send technical questions or improvement suggestions?**

A
: There are several ways to do this:
- Issue/Pull Request on GitHub
- Comment in NOTE
- Mention in X
- Email (if public)

All suggestions are welcome.
This is an open source project
.

**Q25: How do I donate or invest?**

A
: At this time (November 2025), we do not have a system in place to accept direct donations or investments,
as we do not have a fully organized organization .

However:
- Spreading information
- Local practice
- Influencing related companies and organizations
- Requesting the government

These are also important investments.

Once the funding is ready, we
will make an announcement on GitHub or NOTE.

**Q26: I would like to participate in prototype manufacturing?**

A
: Thank you very much.
You can participate in the following ways:

[Engineers and researchers]
Cooperation in design, analysis, and testing

[Manufacturer]
Parts supply and manufacturing cooperation

[Funding provider]
Prototype manufacturing costs provided

[Other]
Ideas, networks, and public relations cooperation


We plan to publish recruitment information on GitHub and NOTE.

**Q27: I want to create an eco-district in my city?**

A
: Great! We recommend the following steps:

1. Gather a group of people (at least 10-20 people)
2. Share this paper and deepen understanding
3. Research the current situation in the region (environment, resources, issues, etc.)
4. Create a feasible plan (starting on a small scale)
5. Approach the government and businesses
6. Start a pilot project

We
plan to build a platform for sharing case studies on NOTE and GitHub .

### E.8 Time Questions

**Q28: Is it really only five years? Is it definitely too late after 2030?**

```
A: It's not *absolutely* too late, but
it will be extremely difficult.

Reasons:
- Time lag (20-30 years)
- Tipping point threshold (around +2°C)
- Current pace of warming

If starting in 2030:
Effects will be seen in 2050-2060
↓
At that point, there is a possibility that temperatures will already be above +2.5℃
↓
Many tipping points will be exceeded
↓
Control will be difficult

Therefore, 2025-2030
is the "last chance."


However, we should not give up even after 2030. Better
late than never.

**Q29: Isn't 25 years too long? Can't it be done sooner?**

A
: 25 years is necessary for the following reasons:


1. 100,000 Ocean Breathing Systems - Time-consuming to build -
for urban renovations around the world

2. It takes time to build a social consensus

3. Phased deployment is safe (environmental impact confirmation)

4. Time lag (20-30 years for effects to be seen)

Of course, it would be best if we could accelerate the process.
With sufficient funding, human resources, and social consensus,
it may be possible to shorten the time to 15-20 years.

However, there is also the risk of failure if you rush too quickly. Balance
is key.

**Q30: What if we can't make it by 2050?**

```
A: Even in that case, don't give up.

Even in 2060 and 2070:
- No further worsening of global warming
- Partial recovery
- Foundation for future generations

is possible.

The worst-case scenario (+7-8°C) and
the next-best scenario (+3-4°C)
will have completely different impacts on human civilization.

At any point,
it's worth taking action.

However, the sooner the better, for sure
.
